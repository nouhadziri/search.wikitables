A '''Grammy Award''' (originally called '''Gramophone Award'''), or '''Grammy''', is an honor awarded by [[The Recording Academy]] to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language [[music industry]]. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), the [[Tony Award]]s (stage performance), and the [[Academy Award]]s (motion pictures).

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|The Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012. The [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|59th Grammy Awards]], honoring the best achievements from October 2015 to September 2016, was held on February 12, 2017, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==History==
The Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the phonograph, [[Thomas Edison]]. They finally settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1440,1446700&amp;dq=paul+weston&amp;hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cEgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7065,1739274&amp;dq=paul+weston&amp;hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3612,4838071&amp;dq=paul+weston+grammy&amp;hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first award ceremony]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 28 Grammys were awarded. The number of awards given grew and fluctuated over the years with categories added and removed, at one time reaching over 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timelines.latimes.com/grammy-awards/ |title=Grammys history and winners through the years|date=January 28, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2nd Annual Grammy Awards|second Grammy Awards]], also held in 1959, was the first ceremony to be televised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-239.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ceremony was not aired live until the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1971-220.html |title=Grammy Awards 1971 |work=Grammy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gramophone trophy==
The gold-plated trophies, each depicting a [[gilded]] gramophone, are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in [[Ridgway, Colorado]]. In 1990 the original Grammy design was revamped, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/grammy_making.php |title=Making the Grammy |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year= 2006|accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billings developed a [[zinc]] alloy named grammium, which is trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=And the Grammy Comes From...|last=Williams|first=Nick|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 13, 2016|pages=56&#8211;57|volume=128|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophies with the recipient's name engraved on them are not available until after the award announcements, so &quot;stunt&quot; trophies are re-used each year for the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |title=About Billings Artworks |publisher=Billingsartworks.com |year=2006 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423143518/http://www.billingsartworks.com/about.php |archivedate=April 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Tamara|title=How the Grammy Awards Are Made: 4 Craftsmen and &#8216;Grammium&#8217;|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/arts/music/grammy-award-maker-john-billings.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2009, 7,578 Grammy trophies had been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&amp;newsCategoryID=1 |title=Neil Portnow's 50th Grammy's Telecast Remarks |publisher=grammy com |date=February 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221031851/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2787&amp;newsCategoryID=1 |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
{{Main article|List of Grammy Award categories}}

The &quot;General Field&quot; are four awards which are not restricted by genre.

* [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a full album if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song if other than the performer.
* [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] is awarded to the writer(s)/composer(s) of a single song.
* [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] is awarded to a promising breakthrough performer who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording that establishes the public identity of that artist (which is not necessarily their first proper release).

The only two artists to win all four of these awards are [[Christopher Cross]], who won all four in 1980, and [[Adele]], who won the Best New Artist award in 2009 and the other three in 2012 and 2017.

Other awards are given for performance and production in specific genres, as well as for other contributions such as artwork and video. Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.

Because of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.

===2012 category restructuring===

On April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am Grammy.org, 6 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&amp;B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.

In the [[rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.

In [[R&amp;B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&amp;B album and other R&amp;B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&amp;B Album]] category.

In [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.

The most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archivedate=June 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT090605&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.

In the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.

There were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word &quot;gospel&quot; in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process Grammy announcement, 6 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 84 in 2017.

==Entry process and selection of nominees==
Media companies registered with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and individual members of NARAS (artists and other professionals working in the industry who meet certain criteria) may enter recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.

The resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.&lt;ref name=&quot;VotingProcess&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.

Whereas members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of movies nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.

==Final voting==

After nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/ |title=Grammy Awards Voting Process |publisher=grammy com |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820040650/http://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/voting/ |archivedate=August 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.

In both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.

The eligibility period for the 59th Annual Grammy Awards is October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.

==Venue==
{{main article|List of Grammy Award ceremony locations}}
Prior to 1971, the Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day. Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.

The 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles's [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.

In 2004, the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

The awards ceremony forces the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to play an extended length of road games.

==Criticism==
The Grammy Awards has received criticism from various recording artists and music journalists.

When [[Pearl Jam]] won a Grammy in the category ''[[Best Hard Rock Performance]]'' in 1996, the band's lead singer [[Eddie Vedder]] commented on stage: &quot;I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter. [http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/grammy-the-movies-20080208 &quot;Grammy &amp; The Movies&quot;]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. February 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glen Hansard]], leader of the Irish rock group [[The Frames]], stated in 2008 that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music &quot;that's fully industry based.&quot; He said he wasn't that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two different awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06,0,4879961.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Todd |last=Martens |title=Glen Hansard, Eddie Vedder crash Grammy Awards |date=February 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221000127/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/columnists/contenderqa/env-en-songs6feb06%2C0%2C4879961.story |archivedate=February 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maynard James Keenan]], lead singer of [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of their awards. He explained his reasons:

{{quote|I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses. They don't honor the arts or the artist for what he created. It's the music business celebrating itself. That's basically what it's all about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/tool_int.asp |title=Interview with Maynard James Keenan of Tool |author=Gabriella |publisher=[[NY Rock]] |date=July 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125082736/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/tool_int.asp |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They have also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful albums.&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, Jason (February 10, 2011).

Retrieved on February 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Sinead O'Connor]] became the first musician to refuse a Grammy, boycotting the ceremony after being nominated for Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Alternative Musical Performance. O'Connor would go on to win the latter category. She said that her reasoning came from the Grammys' extreme commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johnny Firecloud |url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/129524-the-grammys-top-10-bashers-boycotters |title=The Grammys Top 10 Bashers &amp; Boycotters |publisher=CraveOnline |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' journalist Randall Roberts criticised the exclusion of [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' from Album of the Year category nominations for the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. He described West's album as &quot;the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Randall|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/11/critics-notebook-your-grannys-awards.html|title=Critic's Notebook: Grammy Awards?

{{quote|The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population...

In an article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', journalist [[Tour&#233; (journalist)|Tour&#233;]] also responded to the snub and expressed his general displeasure with the awards, stating &quot;I don't pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye's masterpiece ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tour&#233;&quot;/&gt; He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to [[Kremlinology]] and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more &quot;mature&quot; hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate &quot;pop-friendly&quot; hip hop albums instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tour&#233;&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Tour&#233; |authorlink=Tour&#233; (journalist) |url=http://ideas.time.com/2011/12/02/grammys-fallout-the-subtle-snubbing-of-kanye/ |title=Tour&#233;: Why The Grammys Snubbed Kanye West's Twisted Fantasy |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 profile for ''[[The New York Times]]'' following the [[53rd Grammy Awards]], frontman [[Justin Vernon]] of indie band [[Bon Iver]] was asked his opinion of the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded,

&lt;blockquote&gt;You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like &quot;I would go and I would&quot; &#8211; and I don't think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy &#8211; &quot;I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: &quot;Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important.&quot; That's what I would say.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caramanica&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/the-bon-iver-grammy-quandary/ |title=The Bon Iver Grammy Quandary |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=The 6th Floor |date=December 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He reaffirmed this sentiment and commented about the Grammys, saying:

{{quote|[Ninety-eight]&lt;!-- Changed from &quot;98&quot; because numbers that begin a sentence are spelled out, per [[WP:NUMERAL]]. --&gt; percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they're thinking that, and that they're hoping to get that award. And who is that award given by? It's like they think it's literally handed down by the musical-history gods. And I don't know who the voters are. Like, I have a friend who's a voter who was like, &quot;I had to be a voter because I don't trust the other voters.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Me either!&quot; And it's just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caramanica&quot;/&gt;}}

Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caramanica&quot;/&gt; After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, &quot;It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Amy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/bon-iver-grammys_n_1272975.html |title=Grammys 2012: Bon Iver Wins Best New Artist, Feels Conflicted About It |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article &quot;Everything Is Praised Again&quot;, Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' criticized Grammy voters for being &quot;conservative&quot; and disregarding more &quot;forward-looking&quot; music, and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, &quot;for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caramanica2&quot;/&gt; He cited the Grammy successes of [[Lauryn Hill]]'s ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill|The Miseducation]]'' (1999), [[Norah Jones]]' ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2003), and [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011) as examples of &quot;the Grammys dropp[ing] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album.&quot; Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, &quot;He didn't even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough, because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caramanica2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Caramanica |first=Jon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/arts/music/at-the-54th-grammy-awards-everything-old-is-praised-again.html |title=At the 54th Grammy Awards, Everything Old Is Praised Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', music executive and author [[Steve Stoute]] criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having &quot;lost touch with contemporary popular culture&quot; and noted &quot;two key sources&quot; for it: &quot;(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoute&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Stoute |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Stoute |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-stoute/steve-stoute-grammys_b_825377.html |title=Steve Stoute: An Open Letter to Neil Portnow, NARAS and the Grammy Awards |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoute accused them of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000) and Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007) in the Album of the Year category, and stated:

{{quote|As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoute&quot;/&gt;}}The Grammys' eligibility period &#8211; which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &#8211; is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that drop in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards, fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adele Grammys Snub: Why Wasn't She Nominated for 2016 Awards for '25'|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. Taylor Swift's ''1989'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album dropped in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = http://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO|website = BuzzFeed|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grammys have also been criticized for being unfavorable and racist to black recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] criticized the awards in a 2017 interview for seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist because of his previous work and because of his heritage. He criticized the snubbing of &quot;[[One Dance]]&quot; for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of &quot;[[Hotline Bling]]&quot; for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song, using it as evidence of The Recording Academy only seeing black artists as capable of producing rap music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2017 show, Adele broke her trophy for Album of the Year in half onstage and gave half to [[Beyonc&#233;]], stating she felt that she didn't deserve to win over the latter's ''[[Lemonade (Beyonc&#233; album)|Lemonade]]''. ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of &quot;sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyonc&#233;, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=13 Feb 2017 |access-date=25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV broadcasts and ratings==
Prior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on [[NBC]]. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.

The Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011 that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years. As part of the new contract the network also airs a &quot;nominations concert&quot; special in the last week of November where the nominees are released during the special that is exclusive to CBS, rather than the traditional early-morning press conference with a release of the nominations seen with most major awards ceremonies which any network takes as part of a [[press pool]].
Beginning in 2006, the number of viewers was counted in live+SD.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/01/28/grammy-awards-tv-ratings/40427/ |title=Grammy Awards TV Ratings Nielsen Ratings - Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Grammys and record sales==
When the televised Grammys came into renown in 1975, a relationship between Grammy Award winners and subsequent record sales began.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Mary|title=Award Ceremony as an Arbiter of Commerce and Canon in the Popular Music Industry|journal=Popular Music|date=2006|volume=1|issue=25|pages=41&#8211;56|doi=10.1017/S0261143005000747}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many articles of ''Billboard'' magazine communicate the commercial impact of winning a Grammy&#8212;improved record sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hampp|first1=Andrew|title=Grammys Bump More Than Sales|journal=Billboard Magazine|date=2013|page=27|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until after 1984 that Grammy recipients' records displayed a substantial increase in sales. This was largely due to an agreement made by NARAS and the National Association of Record Merchandisers (NARM). Under this agreement &quot;record labels provided stickers, posters and other point-of-purchase material emblazoned 'Grammy Nominee' or 'Grammy Award Winner' that retailers could use in order to improve marketing effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;

{{hatnote|This is a list of metropolitan areas. For a list of urban areas, see [[List of urban areas in Europe]]. For a list of cities proper, see [[List of European cities by population within city limits]]. For a list of European cities by country, see [[List of cities in Europe]].}}
[[File:Europa-bei-nacht 1-1024x768.jpg|thumb|300px|Satellite picture of Europe by night. [[Light]] from the major metropolitan areas and cities is clearly visible.]]

This is a '''list of [[metropolitan area]]s in [[Europe]]''', with their population according to three different sources. The list includes metropolitan areas that have a population of over 1 million.

{{TOC right}}

==Sources==
List includes metropolitan areas according only studies of [[ESPON]], [[Eurostat]], and [[OECD]]. For this reason some metropolitan areas, like Italian [[Genoa|Genoa Metropolitan Area]] (population is over 1.510.000 as of 2012 according ''&quot;CityRailway&quot; Official Report''), aren't included in this list, with data by other statistic survey institutes.

Figures in the first column come from the [[ESPON]] project, &quot;Study on Urban Functions&quot;, which defines cities according to the concept of a functional urban area (core urban area defined morphologically on the basis of population density, plus the surrounding labour pool defined on the basis of commuting). Figures in the second column come from [[Eurostat]]'s Urban Audit and correspond to [[Larger Urban Zone]]s (LUZ). Figures in the fourth column come from the [[OECD]] Territorial Reviews and correspond to &quot;metropolitan regions&quot;. Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact.

        The following is a complete list of 25 metropolitan areas in [[Texas]], as defined by the United States [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The largest two are ranked among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the U.S. 

Some metropolitan areas contain metropolitan divisions. Two metropolitan divisions exist within the Dallas&#8211;Fort&amp;nbsp;Worth&#8211;Arlington MSA. The term metropolitan division is used to refer to a county or group of counties within a metropolitan area that has a population core of at least 2.5&amp;nbsp;million. A metropolitan division often functions as a distinct social, economic, and cultural area within the larger region.

==Metropolitan areas==
The following table lists population figures for those metropolitan areas, in rank of population. Population figures are as of the April 1, 2010 U.S. Census estimates.&lt;ref name=metrostats&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 - United States -- Metropolitan Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico  2010 Census National Summary File of Redistricting Data|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_NSRD_GCTPL2.US24PR&amp;prodType=table|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=16 December 2012|author=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
One concept which measures the [[list of largest cities|world's largest cities]] is that of the [[metropolitan area]], which is based on the concept of a ''[[labor market area]]'' and is typically defined as an employment core (an area with a high density of available jobs) and the surrounding areas that have strong [[commuting]] ties to the core. There is currently no generally accepted, globally consistent definition of exactly what constitutes a metropolitan area, thus making comparisons between cities in different countries especially difficult. However, for consistency, the sources on this article include official figures from governments only.

As an alternative to metropolitan area, [[Eurostat]] introduced the concept of the [[Larger Urban Zone]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurometrex.org/Docs/METRO-D/7B-Position-on-Cohesion.pdf Position Statement on Cohesion Policy 2014-2020], EuroMETREX. Retrieved 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[OECD]] defines [[Larger Urban Zone|Functional Urban Areas]] for cities in OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?Datasetcode=CITIES# |title=OEDC Populations in cities| publisher=OEDC| accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Larger Urban Zone and Functional Urban Area define a city as an urban core surrounded by a commuting zone. This is similar to the metropolitan area definition. However, Larger Urban Zones and Functional Urban Areas are perhaps better metrics for comparing cities in different countries given that, unlike metropolitan area, a common methodology is applied.

        [[File:Final Score Andy Roddick vs Saulnier.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Final score of the 2005 singles final of the [[SAP Open]] in San Jose of [[Andy Roddick]] vs [[Cyril Saulnier]].]]

The '''tennis scoring system''' is the standard system by which tennis matches and tournaments are generally operated and scored.

A [[tennis]] [[tournament]] is organized into matches between players (for ''singles'' tournaments) or teams of two players (for ''doubles'' tournaments). The matches of a tournament are grouped into rounds. In round 1, all players (or teams) are paired and play against each other in matches. The losers are said to ''leave'', or be ''out''. They no longer compete in the tournament (this is [[Single-elimination tournament|single elimination]]). The winners are again paired to play in the matches of the next round. The tournament continues until the ''quarterfinal'' round (having eight players or teams playing in pairs), then the ''semifinal'' round (having four players or teams playing in pairs), and finally the ''final'' round (having only two players or teams) are played. The winner of the final round is declared the winner of the entire tournament.

A [[tennis]] match is composed of [[Point (tennis)|points]], games, and sets.  A match is won when a player or a doubles team wins the majority of prescribed sets. Traditionally, matches are either a [[Best-of-three playoff|best of three]] sets or [[Best-of-five playoff|best of five]] sets format.  The best of five set format is typically only played in the men's singles or doubles matches at [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Majors]] and [[Davis Cup]] matches.

A set consists of a number of ''games'' (a minimum of six), which in turn consist of ''[[Point (tennis)|points]]'', with a tiebreak played if the set is tied at six games per player. Tennis scoring rests on the premise that serving is advantageous over receiving, hence it is only possible to win a set or match by [[Glossary of tennis#break|breaking the opponent's service game]] at least once, before a tiebreak is required. Likewise, it is not possible to win a tiebreak without winning at least one point during an opponent's turn at serve (called a [[Glossary of tennis#mini-break|mini-break]]).

==Game score==

===Description===
A game consists of a sequence of [[Point (tennis)|points]] played with the same player serving, and is won by the first player (or players) to have won at least four points by two points or more over their opponent.  In scoring an individual standard game of tennis, the server's score is always called first and the opponent's score second. Score calling is unique to the sport of tennis in that each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value.

In tennis, scoring in tie situations in which both players have won the same number of points also varies. When players are tied by one or two points, the score is described as &quot;15-all&quot; and &quot;30-all&quot;, or &quot;15-up&quot; and &quot;30-up&quot;, respectively. However, if each player has won three points, the score is described as &quot;'''deuce'''&quot;  rather than &quot;40&#8211;all&quot;.  From this point on, whenever the score is tied, it is described as &quot;deuce&quot; regardless of how many points have been played.

In standard play, scoring beyond a &quot;deuce&quot; score, in which both players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two  points ahead in order to win the game.  This type of tennis scoring is known as &quot;advantage scoring&quot; (or &quot;ads&quot;).  In this type of scoring, the player who wins the next point after deuce is said to have the '''advantage'''. If the player with advantage loses the next point, the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the player with the advantage wins the next point, that player has won the game, since the player now leads by two points.  When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be stated by him or her before the next point as &quot;advantage in&quot;. When the server's opponent has the advantage, the server may state the score as &quot;advantage out&quot;. These phrases are sometimes shortened to &quot;ad in&quot; (or &quot;my ad&quot;) and &quot;ad out&quot; (or &quot;your ad&quot;). Alternatively, the server may simply use players' names; in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g., &quot;advantage [[Roger Federer|Federer]]&quot; or  &quot;advantage [[Andy Murray|Murray]]&quot;).

The table below shows the scoring for tie breaks:

The current point score is announced orally before each point by the judge, or by the server if there is no judge. When stating the score, the server's score is stated first. If the server (or the judge) announces the score as &quot;30&#8211;love&quot;, for example, it means that the server has won two points and the receiver none.

In the [[USTA]] rule book (but not the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] rules) there is the comment: &#8216;&quot;Zero,&quot; &quot;one,&quot; &quot;two,&quot; and &quot;three,&quot; may be substituted for &quot;Love,&quot; &quot;15,&quot; &quot;30,&quot; and &quot;40.&quot; This is particularly appropriate for matches with an inexperienced player or in which one player does not understand English.&#8217;&lt;ref&gt;

===History===
The origins of the 15, 30, and 40 scores are believed to be medieval French. The earliest reference is in a ballad by [[Charles, Duke of Orl&#233;ans|Charles D'Orleans]] in 1435 which refers to ''quarante cinque'' (which gave rise to modern 40) and in 1522 there is a sentence in Latin &quot;we are winning thirty, we are winning forty-five&quot;. The first recorded theories about the origin of fifteen were published in 1555 and 1579. However the origins of this convention remain obscure.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Tennis: Origin and mysteries|first=Malcolm|last=Whitman|chapter=The Mystery of Fifteen in Scoring|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2004|edition=reprint of 1932}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that clock faces were used on court, with a quarter move of the hand to indicate a score of 15, 30, and 45. When the hand moved to 60, the game was over. However, in order to ensure that the game could not be won by a one-point difference in players' scores, the idea of &quot;''deuce''&quot; was introduced. To make the score stay within the &quot;60&quot; ticks on the clock face, the 45 was changed to 40. Therefore, if both players have 40, the first player to score receives ten and that moves the clock to 50. If the player scores a second time before the opponent is able to score, they are awarded another ten and the clock moves to 60. The 60 signifies the end of the game. However, if a player fails to score twice in a row, then the clock would move back to 40 to establish another &quot;''deuce''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-31/news/1998243026_1_tennis-scoring-bud-collins-love-tennis | title=The Baltimore Sun: A scoring system you have to love | accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thepostgame.com/features/201106/so-whats-scoring-system-and-other-tennis-faqs | title=Yahoo Sports: So What's Up With The Strange Scoring System? | accessdate=29 January 2014 | author=Hart, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this suggestion might sound attractive, the medieval period ran until the 15th century (i.e until 1499) at which time clocks recorded only the hours (1 to 12). It wasn't until 1690 that clocks regularly had minute hands when the pendulum system was invented and such a valuable piece of delicate equipment would not have been on an early tennis court where it could easily have been damaged. So the concept of tennis scores originating from the clock face, could not have come from medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time and Timekeepers|last=Milham|first=Willis I.|publisher=MacMillan|year=|isbn=0-7808-0008-7|location=New York|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another theory is that the scoring nomenclature came from the French game ''[[jeu de paume]]'' (a precursor to tennis which initially used the hand instead of a racket). Jeu de paume was very popular before the French revolution, with more than 1,000 courts in Paris alone. The traditional court was 90&amp;nbsp;ft in total with 45&amp;nbsp;ft on each side. When the server scored, he moved forward 15&amp;nbsp;ft. If he scored again, he would move another 15&amp;nbsp;ft. If he scored a third time, he could only move 10&amp;nbsp;ft closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jeu de Paume: History | publisher=R&#233;union des mus&#233;es nationaux | author=Fran&#231;oise Bonnefoy | year=1991 | page=42 | isbn=9782908901016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the use of &quot;love&quot; for zero is also disputed. It is possible that it derives from the French expression for &quot;the egg&quot; (''l'&#339;uf'') because an egg looks like the number zero.&lt;ref&gt;Palmatier, Robert.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&amp;f=false Speaking of animals: a dictionary of animal metaphors], page 245 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Geoffrey.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=tQoY647Kk-wC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=love+l%27oeuf+tennis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Flr8S8ukFYOB8gb_4ND6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=love%20l%27oeuf%20tennis&amp;f=false Rafael Nadal], page 13 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the origin of the term &quot;duck&quot; in [[cricket]], supposedly from &quot;duck's egg&quot;, referring to a batsman who has been called out without completing a run. One possibility comes from the Dutch expression ''iets voor lof doen'', which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes.&lt;ref&gt;Bondt, Cees de (1993) ''Heeft yemant lust met bal, of met reket te spelen...?'' Hilversum: Uitgeverij Verloren p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory on the origins of the use of &quot;love&quot; comes from the acceptance that, at the start of any match, when scores are at zero, players still have &quot;love for each other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Collynshum, Cirt Frijk (1971) ''Brikt noordjest tennis ul areven'' Kreb.: Steken of en lad Verk p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative (&quot;no-ad&quot;) game scoring===
A popular alternative to advantage scoring is &quot;no-advantage&quot; (or &quot;no-ad&quot;) scoring, created by [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]] in order to shorten match playing time.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  No-advantage scoring is a scoring method in which the first player to reach four points wins the game.  No-ad scoring eliminates the requirement that a player must win by two points.  Therefore, if the game is tied at deuce, the next player to win a point wins the game.  This method of scoring is used in most [[World TeamTennis]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usta.com/Improve-Your-Game/Rules/Rules-and-Line-Calls/Scoring/ | title=USTA: Improve Your Game | accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=75 | title=WTT Rules | accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When this style of play is implemented, at deuce, the receiver then chooses from which side of the court he desires to return his opponent's serve.  However, in no-ad mixed doubles play gender always serves to the same gender at game point and during the final point of tiebreaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/technical/rules/equipment/appendixiv.asp], ITF &quot;Rules of Tennis 2010&quot;, Appendix IV &#8211; Alternative Procedures and Scoring Methods&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|Set_score}}Set score==

===Description===
In tennis, a set consists of a sequence of games played with alternating service and return roles. There are two types of set formats that require different types of scoring.&lt;ref&gt;ITF, &quot;Rules of Tennis 2010&quot; p.&amp;nbsp;6 http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_46376_original.PDF Last visited: 22 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''advantage set'' is played until a player or team wins 6 games and that player or team has a 2-game lead over their opponent(s).  The set continues, without tiebreak(er), until a player or team wins the set by 2 games.  Advantage sets are no longer played under the rules of the [[United States Tennis Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dps.usta.com/usta_master/usta/doc/content/doc_13_4204.pdf Last visited 22 April 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; however they are still used in the final sets in men's and women's draws in singles of the [[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and [[Fed Cup]]. Mixed doubles at the Grand Slams except for [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] are a best-of-three format with the final set being played as a &quot;Super Tie Break&quot; (sometimes referred to as a &quot;best of two&quot; format) except at Wimbledon, which still plays a best-of-three match with the final set played as an advantage set and the first two played as tie-break sets.

A ''tie-break set'' is played with the same rules as the advantage set, except when the score is tied at 6&#8211;6, a tie-break game (or tiebreaker) is played.  Typically, the tie-break game continues until one player wins seven points by a margin of two or more points. However, many tie-break games are played with different tiebreak point requirements, such as 8 or 10 points.

The score of games within a set is counted in the ordinary manner, except when a player or team has a score of no games it is read as &quot;love&quot;.  The score is written using digits separated by a dash.  This score is announced by the judge or server at the start of each game.

In doubles, service alternates between the teams. One player serves for an entire service game, with that player's partner serving for the entirety of the team's next service game. Players of the receiving team receive the serve on alternating points, with each player of the receiving team declaring which side of the court (deuce or ad side) they will receive serve on for the duration of the set.

=== Comparison ===

''Advantage sets'' have a tendency to go significantly longer than ''tie-break sets''.  The [[Isner&#8211;Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 Wimbledon first-round match]] between [[John Isner]] and [[Nicolas Mahut]], which is the longest professional tennis match in history, notably ended with Isner winning the 5th set, 70&#8211;68. The match lasted in total 11 hours and 5 minutes with the 5th set alone lasting 8 hours, 11 minutes.

Nevertheless, even tie-break sets can last a long time. For instance, once players reach 6&#8211;6 set score and also reach 6&#8211;6 tiebreaker score, play must continue until one player has a 2-point advantage, which can take [[Longest tiebreaker in tennis|a considerable time]]. Sets decided by tiebreakers, however, are typically significantly shorter than extended advantage sets.

The set is won by the first player (or team) to have won at least six games and at least two games more than his or her opponent. Traditionally, sets would be played until both these criteria had been met, with no maximum number of games. To shorten matches, [[Jimmy Van Alen|James Van Alen]] created a tie-breaker system, which was widely introduced in the early 1970s. If the score reaches 6&#8211;5 (or 5-6), one further game is played. If the leading player wins this game, he wins the set 7&#8211;5 (or 5-7). If the trailing player wins the game, the score is tied at 6&#8211;6 and a special tiebreaker game is played. The winner of the tiebreak wins the set by a score of 7&#8211;6 (or 6-7).

The tiebreak is sometimes not employed for the final set of a match and an advantage set is used instead. Therefore, the deciding set must be played until one player or team has won two more games than the opponent. This is true in three of the four major tennis championships, all except the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] where a tiebreak is played even in the deciding set (fifth set for the men, third set for the women) at 6&#8211;6.  A tiebreak is not played in the deciding set in the other three majors &#8212; the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open]], and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. (When the tiebreak was first introduced at Wimbledon in 1971, it was invoked at 8&#8211;8 rather than 6&#8211;6.)

===Scoring a tiebreak game=== &lt;!-- [[Tiebreaker (tennis)]] redirects here. don't change the header! --&gt;
At a score of 6&#8211;6, a set is often determined by one more game called a &quot;twelve point tiebreaker&quot;. Only one more game is played to determine the winner of the set; the score of the set is always 7&#8211;6 (or 6&#8211;7). Points are counted using ordinary numbering.  The set is decided by the player who wins at least seven points in the tiebreak but also has two points more than his opponent. For example, if the score is 6 points to 5 points and the player with 6 points wins the next point, he or she wins the tiebreak and the set. If the player with 5 points wins the point, the tiebreak continues and cannot be won on the next point, since no player will be two points better than his opponent.  In the scoring of the set, sometimes the tiebreak points are included as well as the game count, for example 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(7&#8211;5)&lt;/sup&gt;. Another way of listing the score of the tiebreak is to list only the loser's points.  For example, if the set score is listed as 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(8)&lt;/sup&gt;, the tiebreak score was 10&#8211;8 (since 8 is the loser's points, and the winner must win by two points). Similarly, 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; means the tiebreak score was 7&#8211;3.

The player who would normally be serving after 6&#8211;6 is the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a service game for this player. The server begins his service from the [[deuce court]] and serves one point. After the first point, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. Each player then serves two consecutive points for the remainder of the tiebreak. The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's [[advantage court]] and the second starts from the [[deuce court]]. In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; note that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence.  At the end of the tiebreak, the players switch ends of the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games).

An alternative tie-break system called the &quot;Coman Tie-Break&quot; is sometimes used by the United States Tennis Association. Scoring is the same, but end changes take place after the first point and then after every four points. This approach allows the servers of doubles teams to continue serving from the same end of the court as during the body of the set. It also reduces the advantage the elements (e.g. wind and sun) could give playing the first six points of a seven-point tiebreak on one side of the court.

====History of the tiebreak====
The tiebreaker &#8212; more recently shortened to just &quot;tiebreak&quot;, though both terms are still used interchangeably &#8212; was invented by [[Jimmy Van Alen (tennis player)|James Van Alen]] and unveiled in 1965 as an experiment at the pro tournament he sponsored at Newport Casino, Rhode Island,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague%201992%2C%20Aki%20Rahunen%20%20Peter%20Nyborg&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; after an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to speed up the game by the use of his so-called &quot;Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System&quot; (&quot;VASSS&quot;). For two years before the Open Era, in 1955 and 1956, the [[United States Pro Championship]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], was played by VASSS rules. The scoring was the same as that in [[table tennis]], with sets played to 21 points and players alternating five services, with no second service.  The rules were created partially to limit the effectiveness of the powerful service of the reigning professional champion, [[Pancho Gonzales]]. Even with the new rules, however, Gonzales beat [[Pancho Segura]] in the finals of both tournaments. Even though the 1955 match went to 5 sets, with Gonzales barely holding on to win the last one 21&#8211;19, it is reported to have taken 47 minutes to complete.&lt;ref&gt;USTA Midwest,http://www.midwest.usta.com/content/custom.sps?iType=1435&amp;icustompageid=2647&lt;/ref&gt; The fans attending the matches preferred the traditional rules, however, and in 1957 the tournament reverted to the old method of scoring.

Van Alen called his innovation a &quot;tiebreaker&quot;, and he actually proposed two different kinds or versions of it: ''best-five-of-nine-points tiebreaker'' and ''best-seven-of-twelve-points tiebreaker''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague%201992%2C%20Aki%20Rahunen%20%20Peter%20Nyborg&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The first lasts a maximum of 9 points, and awards victory in the set to whichever player or team first reaches 5 points &#8212; even if the other player or team already has 4; the margin of victory can be a single point.  Because this &quot;9-point&quot; tiebreaker ''must'' end after a maximum of 9 points, even if neither player or team has a 2-point (or greater) margin, Van Alen also called it a &quot;sudden-death tiebreaker&quot; (If and when the score reached four points all, both players faced simultaneous set point and/or match point.). This type of tiebreaker had its Grand Slam debut at 1970 [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and was employed there until 1974. Apart from being used for 5 years at US Open it was also used 1 year at Wimbledon and for a while on the Virginia Slims circuit and in American Colleges.

The other type of tiebreaker Van Alen introduced is the &quot;12-point&quot; tiebreaker that is most familiar and widely used today.  Because it ends as soon as either player or team reaches 7 points &#8212; provided that that player or team leads the other at that point by ''at least'' two points &#8212; it ''can'' actually be over in as few as 7 points.  However, because the winning player or team ''must'' win by a margin of at least two points, a &quot;12-point&quot; tiebreaker may go beyond 12 points &#8212; sometimes [[Longest tiebreaker in tennis|well beyond]].  That is why Van Alen derisively likened it to a &quot;lingering death&quot;, in contrast to the 9-point (or fewer) &quot;sudden-death tiebreaker&quot; that he recommended and preferred.

The impetus to use ''some'' kind of a tie-breaking procedure gained force after a monumental 1969 struggle at Wimbledon between [[Pancho Gonzales]] and [[Charlie Pasarell]]. This was a 5-set match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes and took 2 days to complete. In the fifth set the 41-year-old Gonzales won all seven match points that Pasarell had against him, twice coming back from 0&#8211;40 deficits. The final score was 22&#8211;24, 1&#8211;6, 16&#8211;14, 6&#8211;3, 11&#8211;9 for Gonzales.

The tiebreaker gave tennis a definite &quot;finish line&quot;.

:''In what follows, the &quot;final set&quot; means the fifth set for best-of-five matches, and the third set for best-of-three matches.''

In 1971, the nine-point tiebreaker was introduced at Wimbledon (the first scoring change at Wimbledon in 94 years).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague%201992%2C%20Aki%20Rahunen%20%20Peter%20Nyborg&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Wimbledon put into effect a twelve-point tiebreaker when the score in a set reached 8&#8211;8 in games unless the set was one in which one of the players could achieve a match victory by winning it.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=Z1cr577EpcUC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;lpg=PT365&amp;dq=Copenhague+1992,+Aki+Rahunen++Peter+Nyborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jNDp2gSl7-&amp;sig=pfiJXoUfBUsQfVPifHu4SGebS0g&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=cPDZTpbZIdCChQeKpvy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Copenhague%201992%2C%20Aki%20Rahunen%20%20Peter%20Nyborg&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Wimbledon changed their rules so that a (twelve-point) tiebreak would be played once any set except the final set reached 6&#8211;6 in games.

In 1989, the Davis Cup adopted the tie-break in all sets except for the final set, and then extended it to the final set starting in 2016.

In 2001, the Australian Open replaced the deciding third set of mixed doubles with a &quot;match tiebreak&quot; (first to 10 points and win by two points wins the match).&lt;ref&gt;CNNSI.com, &quot;Reactions: Mixed doubles, Responses overwhelmingly against new format&quot; http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/your_turn/news/2001/01/16/reactions_mixeddoubles/ Last visited: 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some criticism of the change by fans and former pros,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What They're Saying about Tiebreakers Replacing Third Sets...&quot; http://www.tennisconfidential.com/articles6.htm Last visited: 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the US Open and the French Open have since gone on to join the Australian Open in using the same format for mixed doubles.  Wimbledon continues to play a traditional best of three match, requiring an advantage set for the third set.

Tie-break sets are now nearly universal in all levels of play, for all sets in a match; however, the tie-break is not a compulsory element in any set, and the actual formatting of sets and tie-breaks depends on the tournament director in tournaments, and, in private matches, on the players' agreement before play begins. Tie-breaks are not used in the final set in the [[Australian Open]] for singles, the [[French Open]] for singles, [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], or the [[Fed Cup]], nor were they used for final sets in [[Davis Cup]] play or the [[Olympics]] before 2016. The [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] now uses a tiebreak in the final set, both in singles and in doubles, and is the only [[Grand Slam (tennis)|major tournament]] to use a tiebreak in the final set for singles. However, the Australian Open and French Open do now use a final set tiebreak in both men's and women's doubles.

===Alternative set scoring format===
While traditional sets continue until a player wins at least six games by a margin of at least two games there are some alternative set scoring formats in use.  A common alternative set format is the eight game pro set.  Instead of playing until one player reaches six games with a margin of two games, one plays until one player wins eight games with a margin of two games.  A tie-break is then played at eight games all.  While the format is not used in modern professional matches or recognized by the ITF rules, it was supposedly used in early professional tours.  It is commonly utilized in various amateur leagues and high school tennis as a shorter alternative to a best of three match, but longer than a traditional tie-break set. In addition, eight game pro sets were used during doubles for all Division I college dual matches, until the 2014-2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;Improving your game | Scoring http://www.usta.com/Improve-Your-Game/Rules/Rules-and-Line-Calls/Scoring/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative set format are so called &quot;short sets&quot; where the first to four games to win by two games.  In this format a tie-break is played at four games all.  The ITF experimented with this format in low level Davis Cup matches, but the experiment was not continued.  Nevertheless, this alternative remains as an acceptable alternative in the ITF rules of Tennis.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of Tennis 2010  http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_46376_original.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative set format is seen in [[World Team Tennis]] where the winner of a set is the first to win five games and a nine-point tie-break is played at 4&#8211;4.

==Match score==

===Description===
Most singles matches consist of an odd number of sets, the match winner being the player who wins more than half of the sets. The match ends as soon as this winning condition is met. Men's singles and doubles matches may consist of up to five sets (the winner being the first to take the majority of total allocated sets) while women's singles matches are usually best of three sets. Doubles matches (including mixed doubles) are usually best of three sets, with a Super Tiebreak to ten points played if the score reaches a set all.

While the alternation of service between games continues throughout the match without regard to sets, the ends are changed after each odd game within a set (including the last game). If, for example, the second set of a match ends with the score at 6&#8211;3, 1&#8211;6, the ends are changed as the last game played was the 7th (odd) game of the set and in spite of it being the 16th (even) game of the match. Notably, in situations where a set ends with an odd game, back to back games see change of ends&#8212;i.e., ends are changed before and after the first game of the following set. A tiebreaker game is treated as a single game for the purposes of this alternation. Since tiebreakers always result in a score of 7&#8211;6, there is always a court change after the tiebreaker.

The score of a complete match may be given simply by sets won, or with the scores of each set given separately. In either case, the match winner's score is stated first. In the former, shorter form, a match might be listed as 3&#8211;1 (i.e. three sets to one). In the latter form, this same match might be further described as &quot;7&#8211;5, 6&#8211;7&lt;sup&gt;(4&#8211;7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&#8211;4, 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(8&#8211;6)&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;. (As noted above, an alternate form of writing the tiebreak score lists only the loser's score&#8212;e.g., &quot;6&#8211;7&lt;sup&gt;(4)&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; for the second set in the example.) This match was won three sets to one, with the match loser winning the second set on a tiebreaker. The numbers in parentheses, normally included in printed scorelines but omitted when spoken, indicate the duration of the tiebreaker following a given set. Here, the match winner lost the second-set tiebreaker 7&#8211;4 and won the fourth-set tiebreaker 8&#8211;6.

===Total points won===
Because tennis is scored set by set and game by game, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of points and/or games played.

Consider a player who wins six games in each of two sets, all by a score of game&#8211;30. The winner has scored 4&#215;12 = 48 points and the loser 2&#215;12 = 24. Suppose also that the loser wins four games in each set, all by a score of game-love. The loser has scored 4&#215;8 = 32 points and the winner zero in those games. The final score is a win by 6&#8211;4, 6&#8211;4; total points 48&#8211;56.

An example of this in actual practice was the record-breaking [[Isner&#8211;Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|Isner-Mahut match]] in the Wimbledon first round, 22&#8211;24 June 2010. American [[John Isner]] beat [[Nicolas Mahut]] of France 6&#8211;4, 3&#8211;6, 6&#8211;7&lt;sup&gt;(7&#8211;9)&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(7&#8211;3)&lt;/sup&gt;, 70&#8211;68 &#8212; Mahut winning a total of 502 points to Isner's 478.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day11/1160ms.html |title=Wimbledon Championships Website|publisher=Wimbledon.org |date=1998-09-21 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total games won===
Likewise, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of games played (or win a match despite losing the majority of games). [[Roger Federer]] won the 2009 Wimbledon final over [[Andy Roddick]] (5&#8211;7, 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(8&#8211;6)&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(7&#8211;5)&lt;/sup&gt;, 3&#8211;6, 16&#8211;14) despite Roddick's winning more games (39, versus Federer's 38).

==Announcing the score==
If there is no judge to announce the score of a match, there is a specific protocol for stating the score. During a game, the server has the responsibility to announce the game score before he serves. He does this by announcing his score first. If, for example, the server loses the first three points of his service game, he would say &quot;love&#8211;forty&quot;. This convention is used consistently. After a set is complete, the server, before serving for the first game of the next set, announces the set scores so far completed in the match, stating his scores first. If he has won the first two sets and is beginning the third, he would say, &quot;two&#8211;love, new set.&quot; If he had lost the first two sets, he would say, &quot;love&#8211;two, new set.&quot; Finally, after the completion of the match, either player, when asked the score, announces his scores first.

As an example, consider a match between [[Victoria Azarenka]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]]. Azarenka wins the first set 6&#8211;4, Ivanovic wins the next set 7&#8211;6&lt;sup&gt;(7&#8211;4)&lt;/sup&gt;, and Azarenka wins the final set 6&#8211;0.

At the end of each set, the umpire would announce the winner of each set:
:''Game, first set, Azarenka.''
:''Game, second set, Ivanovic.''

At the completion of the match, the result would be announced as:

:''Game, set, match, (Victoria) Azarenka, two sets to one, six&#8211;four, six&#8211;seven, six&#8211;love.''

The result would be written as:

:{{flagicon|BLR}} '''Victoria Azarenka''' defeated {{flagicon|SRB}} Ana Ivanovic 6&#8211;4, 6&#8211;7&lt;sup&gt;(4&#8211;7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&#8211;0

The score is always written and announced in respect to the winner of the match. The score of the tiebreak is not included in announcing the final result; it is simply said &quot;seven&#8211;six&quot; or &quot;six&#8211;seven&quot; regardless of the score in the tiebreak.

If a match ends prematurely due to one player retiring or being disqualified (defaulting), the partial score at that point is announced as the final score, with the remaining player as the nominal winner. For instance, the result in the final of the [[2012 Aegon Championships]] is written:

:{{flagicon|CRO}} '''[[Marin &#268;ili&#263;]]''' defeated {{flagicon|ARG}} [[David Nalbandian]] 6&#8211;7&lt;sup&gt;(3&#8211;7)&lt;/sup&gt;, 4&#8211;3 (default)

=== Variations and slang ===
During informal play of tennis, especially at tennis clubs in the U.S. (also in other English speaking countries), score announcements are frequently shortened with the use of abbreviations. For example, a score fifteen is replaced with &quot;five&quot;, or in some cases &quot;fif&quot;. Similarly, the scores of thirty and forty may sometimes be spoken as &quot;three&quot; or &quot;four&quot; respectively. A score of fifteen-all may sometimes be announced as &quot;fives.&quot; To further confuse score announcements, a score of thirty-all (30&#8211;30) may often be called &quot;deuce&quot;, and the following point referred to as &quot;ad in&quot; or &quot;ad out&quot; (or &quot;my ad&quot; or &quot;your ad&quot;), depending on which player (or team) won the point. The logic for this is that a thirty-all score is ''effectively'' the same as deuce (40&#8211;40).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/showthread.php?t=258764 |title=Why do club players say &quot;five&quot; not &quot;fifteen&quot; when scoring? - Talk Tennis |publisher=Tt.tennis-warehouse.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2014}}

==Scorecards==

For formal scorekeeping, the official scoring the match (e.g. the chair umpire) fills out a scorecard, either on paper or electronically. The scorecard allows the official to record details for each point, as well as rule violations and other match information. Standard markings for each point are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/USTA_Import/USTA/dps/doc_13_2319.pdf USTA Chair Umpire Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

* &#8260; &#8211; point won
* A &#8211; point won via ace
* D &#8211; point won via double-fault
* C &#8211; point won via code violation
* T &#8211; point won via time violation

An additional dot is marked in a score box to indicate a missed first serve fault.

The [[tennis]] tournaments at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London were staged at the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|All England Club]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], from 28 July to 5 August. This was the first Olympic [[grass court]] tournament since tennis was reintroduced as an Olympic sport and the first to be held at a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] venue in the Open era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tennis at the 2012 London Games&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympictennis.net|title=Olympic Tennis|publisher=UK Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Two other 2012 Summer Olympic bid finalists had also offered Grand Slam venues &#8211; second-place finisher Paris offered the  [[French Open]] venue, the [[Stade Roland Garros]], while fourth-place finisher New York offered the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] venue, the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park]], [[Queens]].)

A total of 190 players competed in five events: singles and doubles for both men and women and, for the first time since 1924, mixed doubles were officially included. The Olympic tennis events were run and organised by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) and the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), and were part of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) tours. As a side effect, the regular rule imposed by the All England Club during The Championships calling for all-white player clothing was waived to allow players to wear Olympic national team clothing, and London 2012 bunting also mixed with the traditional Wimbledon green.

[[Elena Dementieva]] and [[Rafael Nadal]] were the reigning champions, neither of whom defended their titles. Dementieva had retired from professional tennis in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elena Dementieva retiring from tour|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=5741128|publisher=ESPN Sport|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Nadal withdrew due to tendinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012: Rafael Nadal withdraws from Olympics|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18909111|work=BBC Sport|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In the women's singles tournament, [[Serena Williams]] defeated [[Maria Sharapova]] while losing only one game in the final for the gold medal and her sixth major event win at Wimbledon, having won the ladies' singles tournament at The Championships less than three weeks earlier as well as in 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2010. She also defended her women's doubles title alongside her [[Williams sisters|sister]] [[Venus Williams]], who had won singles gold in Sydney in 2000. With her singles gold, she became the second female player to win a career singles [[Grand Slam (tennis)#Golden Slam|Golden Slam]] - Olympic gold in addition to the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, with the first being [[Steffi Graf]] in 1988 after she won all five events that year (a feat not yet matched by another player, male or female.)  Williams also became the first player in history, male or female, to win the career Golden Grand Slam in both singles and doubles (the Williams sisters had already completed their career doubles Golden Grand Slam at the 2001 Australian Open, joining [[Pam Shriver]] in Seoul in 1988 and [[Gigi Fern&#225;ndez]] at the 1993 Australian Open.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/04/serena-williams-gold-medal-olympics-sharapova_n_1741297.html|first=Steven|last=Wine|title=Serena Williams Wins Gold Medal In Olympic Singles Tennis, Beats Maria Sharapova In Final|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=7 March 2013|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Williams sisters also became the first four-time gold medalists in Olympic tennis history.

In the men's singles tournament final, [[Andy Murray]] beat [[Roger Federer]] in straight sets in front of a home crowd to avenge his four-set loss against Federer exactly four weeks earlier on Centre Court in the finals at Wimbledon. In doing so, he denied Federer the chance to become the third man to win a career singles Golden Grand Slam after Nadal at the 2010 US Open and [[Andre Agassi]] at the 1999 French Open. He also became the first British man to win singles tennis gold since [[Josiah Ritchie]] in 1908 (also at Wimbledon) and the first to win a major event at Wimbledon since [[Fred Perry]] won The Championships in 1936. Based on his gold medal as well as his achievements over the following four years, including a US Open championship, two Wimbledon championships and a Davis Cup, Team GB chose him as their flagbearer for the opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, where he won a second consecutive gold medal.

Meanwhile, the [[Bryan brothers]] (Mike and Bob) took the men's doubles gold for the United States and themselves completed a career Golden Grand Slam, joining the Australian &quot;Woodies&quot; ([[Todd Woodbridge]] and [[Mark Woodforde]], who completed their set at the 2000 French Open) and Canada's [[Daniel Nestor]] at Wimbledon in 2009. Also, the Belorussian top seeds of [[Victoria Azarenka]] and [[Max Mirnyi]] took the mixed doubles gold after overcoming Murray and [[Laura Robson]] mere hours after Murray had defeated Federer.

==Tournament==
[[File:London 2012 Federer-Isner Quarterfinal Warm Up.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Isner]] and [[Roger Federer]] warming up prior to their men's singles quarterfinal match on [[Centre Court]]]] The 2012 Olympic tournament was the fourteenth edition of tennis at the Olympics (excluding the two Olympics, 1968 and 1984, when tennis was a demonstration event), and the seventh since 1988, when tennis was officially brought back into the Olympic Games. Mixed doubles was an official Olympic event for the first time since 1924, when [[Hazel Wightman]] and [[Richard Norris Williams|Richard Williams]] of the United States won the gold medal, and was played for the first time since it was played as a demonstration event in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Olympic Committee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.olympic.org/media?articlenewsgroup=-1&amp;articleid=75443&amp;calendartab=0|title=IOC approves new events for London 2012|publisher=IOC|date=10 December 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennis at the 1924 Paris Summer Games: Mixed Doubles|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1924/TEN/mixed-doubles.html|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2012 tournaments were played on grass courts at the [[All England Club]], three weeks after the end of the [[2012 Wimbledon Championships|2012 edition of The Championships]]. Sessions ran from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m. as established by the All England Club policy. However, the All England Club along with other organizers not only allowed but encouraged the players to wear their national colours as opposed to predominantly white clothes in accordance with typical Wimbledon tradition, and the normally all-green grounds were also decked out in purple and multi-coloured London 2012 Olympic branding.

Twelve courts were used for the matches including [[Centre Court]], [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No.1]] and [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No.2]]. [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No.3 Court]] was used for warm ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8912595.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wimbledon outlines plans for 2012 | date=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic tennis events were organised jointly by the ITF, the IOC and the All England Club. Both the men's and women's singles and doubles events counted as a part of the [[2012 ATP World Tour]] and the [[2012 WTA Tour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Site of 2012 Games&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/tennis.php|title=Tennis|publisher=London 2012 Organisation Committee|accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
{{Main|Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics &#8211; Qualification}}
For the singles competitions, the top 56 players in the world rankings on 11 June 2012 of the WTA and ATP tours qualified for the Olympics. However, entry was limited to four players from a country.  This means that players who were ranked in the top 56 but are from countries with four higher-ranked players already participating did not qualify, and players who were ranked outside of the top 56 but are from countries with fewer than four players already participating qualified. A player could only participate if he or she had made him- or herself available to be drafted to represent the player's country in [[Davis Cup]] or [[Fed Cup]] for two of the following years:  2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, with one of the years being either 2011 or 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2012.itftennis.com/olympics/news/articles/olympic-qualification-details-announced.aspx|format=|title=Olympic qualification details announced|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|work=itftennis.com|date=20 June 2011|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other eight wildcard slots, six of the slots were determined by the ITF's Olympic Committee, taking into account ranking and spread of nations represented, while the final two slots were awarded by the IOC to players from small nations.

In the doubles competitions, twenty four teams automatically qualified as per the rankings on 11 June 2012, subject to a maximum of two teams per nation. Players in the top ten of the doubles rankings could reserve a place, provided they had a partner to compete with. The remaining eight teams were decided by the ITF's Olympic Committee. Entries for the mixed doubles were confirmed at the Games.&lt;ref&gt;http://2012.itftennis.com/media/80030/80030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/shared/medialibrary/pdf/original/IO_57746_original.PDF|format=PDF|title=ITF and ATP announce Olympic ranking point agreement|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|work=ATP and ITF|date=1 June 2011|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tripartite Commission later decided only to give places in the women's singles leaving eight wildcards to be chosen by the 
ITF Olympic Committee for the men's singles competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF trip&quot;&gt;http://2012.itftennis.com/olympics/news/articles/first-olympic-entries-are-revealed.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition of Olympics==

===Format===
The tennis competition at the Olympic Games consists of a [[single elimination]] tournament. The size of the singles draw, 64, means that there are six rounds of competition in total,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/drawsheets/index.asp|title=Men's Singles Main Draw: 1st Round|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with five in the doubles owing to its smaller draw size of 32, and 4 for mixed with its draw size only being 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/olympics/drawsheets/index.asp?Tournament=1100018553&amp;Event=1100104056|title=Men's Doubles Main Draw: 1st Round|publisher=ITF|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players reaching the semifinal are assured of an opportunity to compete for a medal, as the two losing parties in each semifinals contest a [[bronze medal]] match.

In a further change from normal Wimbledon practice, the matches followed the Olympic format &#8211; all matches were three-set matches except for the men's singles final, which would be a five-set match. The [[tie break (tennis)|tie break]] operated in every set except the fifth set in the men's singles final and the third set in the other matches (except mixed doubles), when an [[Glossary of tennis terms#advantage set|advantage set]] was played. In the mixed doubles the third set was played as a match tie-break (10 points).

        [[File:Navratilova-PragueOpen2006-05 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Martina Navratilova won the most singles and doubles titles in the era.]]
This page lists all [[tennis]] players who have won at least 30 top-level professional tournament titles since the [[Open Era]] began in 1968.

Note the following:
* Titles can be any combination of [[types of tennis match|singles and doubles]], so the combined total is the default sorting of the lists.
* Only titles won during the era are included here, though entire spans are listed for careers that started before 1968.
* The current top-level events are on the [[WTA Tour]] for women and the [[ATP World Tour]] for men.

The '''Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance''' is an award presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s to recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality performances in the [[heavy metal music]] genre. The Grammy Awards is an annual ceremony, where honors in several categories are presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] (NARAS) of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/|title=Overview|accessdate=April 24, 2010|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NARAS recognized heavy metal music artists for the first time at the [[31st Grammy Awards]] (1989). The category was originally presented as [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental|Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], combining two of the most [[popular music]] genres of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=February 23, 1989|title=Grammys to McFerrin and Chapman|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/23/arts/grammys-to-mcferrin-and-chapman.html|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] won that award for the album ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'', beating [[Metallica]], which were expected to win with the album ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]''. This choice led to widespread criticism of the NARAS, as journalists suggested that the music of Jethro Tull did not belong in the [[hard rock]] or heavy metal genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|volume=1|editor=Hoffmann, Frank|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|date=2005|edition=2|page=542|isbn=978-0-415-93835-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&amp;lpg=PA542&amp;dq=grammy%20jethro%20tull&amp;pg=PA542#v=onepage&amp;q=grammy%20jethro%20tull&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=February 14, 1990|title=The Pop Life|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/arts/the-pop-life-884490.html|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the NARAS created the categories [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] and Best Metal Performance, separating the genres.

The Best Metal Performance category was first presented at the [[32nd Grammy Awards]] in 1990, and was again the subject of controversy when rock musician [[Chris Cornell]] (lead vocalist for the band [[Soundgarden]]) was perplexed by the organization's nomination of the band [[Dokken]] in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Britt|first=Bruce|date=February 17, 1990|title=It's time again for the Grammy award gripes|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mt0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=grammy%20dokken&amp;pg=5380%2C4759848|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallica won in the first three years. The awards were presented for the song &quot;[[One (Metallica song)|One]]&quot;, a [[cover version]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[Stone Cold Crazy]]&quot;, and the album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]''. During 2012&#8211;2013, the award was temporarily discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories; all solo or duo/group performances in the hard rock and metal categories were shifted to the newly formed [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance|Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance]] category. However, in 2014, the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category was split, returning the Best Metal Performance category and recognizing quality hard rock performances in the [[Best Rock Performance]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-recording-academy-elects-new-national-officers-and-approves|title=The Recording Academy Elects New National Officer and Approves Continuing Evolution of Grammy Awards Categories at Spring Trustees Meeting|date=June 4, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|publisher=Recording Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of six. The bands [[Black Sabbath]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Slayer]], and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] have each received the award twice. The bands [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] hold the record for the most nominations without win, with five.

The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best Comedy Album''' is presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement in comedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was awarded yearly from 1959 to 1993 and then from 2004 to present day.  There have been several minor changes to the name of the award over this time:

*From 1959 to 1967 it was '''Best Comedy Performance'''
*From 1968 to 1991 it was known as '''Best Comedy Recording'''
*From 1992 to 1993 and from 2004 to the present day it was awarded as '''Best Comedy Album'''

In 1960 and 1961 two separate awards were presented for the best spoken and for the best musical comedy performance.

In 1994 the award was restricted to spoken word comedy albums and moved into the &quot;spoken&quot; field. From then through 2003, it was awarded as the Grammy Award for '''Best Spoken Comedy Album'''.

In 2004 the award was reinstated within the comedy field as the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, once again allowing musical comedy works to be considered.

[[Bill Cosby]] holds the record for most consecutive wins, with six earned between 1965 and 1970. [[Peter Schickele]] (of [[P.D.Q. Bach]] fame) is the runner-up, with four wins between 1990 and 1993.

[[Image:Staples Center, LA, CA, jjron 22.03.2012.jpg|thumb|250px|right|upright|alt=|The [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] is the current home of the Grammy Awards and has hosted seventeen times]]

The Grammy Awards have been held in many prestigious locations. In 1971 the Grammy Awards had its first live telecast and therefore had its own sole venue each year for the telecast. From 1963 to 1970 the Academy aired a TV special annually called &quot;The Best On Record&quot; which highlighted the awards dinners. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have been held in the [[Staples Center]] located in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].

==Non-televised era==
From 1959 to 1970 Awards dinners were held in the following locations simultaneously on the same day:
*1959&#8211;1961: [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]]
*1962&#8211;1964: [[Chicago]], Los Angeles and New York
*1965&#8211;1970: Chicago, Los Angeles, [[Nashville]] and New York

==Televised era==

Grammy Award ceremonies have been televised since 1971. The [[Staples Center]] has hosted the most Grammy telecasts, having hosted seventeen times. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] which hosted sixteen times was surpassed by the Staples Center in 2017. Los Angeles has held a total of 36 Grammy Award telecasts, with New York having hosted nine times and Nashville serving as host once.

'''Golf''' is a club and ball [[sport]]&lt;!--consensus is that golf is a sport, not a &quot;game&quot; or &quot;form of sport&quot; or similar so please do not modify this opening line--&gt;&lt;!--Golf, unlike fishing or checkers, is, of course, both a sport AND a game--&gt; in which players use various [[Golf club|clubs]] to hit [[Golf ball|balls]] into a series of holes on a [[golf course|course]] in as few strokes as possible.

Golf, unlike most [[ball game]]s, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area. The game is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes. Each hole on the course must contain a [[Teeing ground|tee box]] to start from, and a [[putting green]] containing the actual hole or cup (4.25 inches in width). There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), sand traps, and hazards (water, rocks, fescue) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.

Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as [[stroke play]], or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as [[match play]]. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels.

==Origin==
{{Main article|History of golf}}
[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|''The MacDonald boys playing golf'', attributed to William Mosman. 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]].]]
While the modern game of golf originated in 15th-century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated. Some historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Brasch, Rudolph | title=How did sports begin?: A look at the origins of man at play | publisher=McKay | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; trace the sport back to the Roman game of [[wikt:paganica|paganica]], in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/438170/paganica |title=paganica (game) &#8211; Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others cite [[chuiwan]] (&quot;chui&quot; means striking and &quot;wan&quot; means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/141Kaleidoscope598.html |title=Golf (Chui wan) &#8211; China culture |publisher=Kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Ming Dynasty scroll dating back to 1368 entitled &quot;The Autumn Banquet&quot; shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages. Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as [[wikt:cambuca|cambuca]] in England and chambot in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;TUGB54&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1=Charles |last2=McCormick |first2=David|last3=Garrity|first3=John|title=The ultimate golf book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=QGvBn-wOy4EC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=lob+wedge+history&amp;ots=W9oxyaUmSP&amp;sig=6ojRy1wz353wbgt2i1xwop7PdRc#PPP1,M1|accessdate=4 May 2009 |year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=13|isbn=978-0-618-71025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian game [[wikt:chaug&#225;n|chaug&#225;n]] is another possible ancient origin. In addition, [[kolven]] (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]], a year earlier.

==Golf course==
[[File:Golf course Golfplatz Wittenbeck Mecklenburg Ostsee Baltic Sea Germany.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the ''Golfplatz [[Wittenbeck]]'' in [[Mecklenburg]], [[Germany]]]]
{{Main article|Golf course}}
A golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes, each with a [[teeing ground]] that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, [[Fairway (golf)#Fairway and rough|fairway]], [[Fairway (golf)#Fairway and rough|rough]] and other [[Hazard (golf)|hazards]], and the [[putting green]] surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup.

The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty, or to allow for putting in the case of the green. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green, some holes may bend either to the left or to the right. This is commonly called a &quot;dogleg&quot;, in reference to a dog's knee. The hole is called a &quot;dogleg left&quot; if the hole angles leftwards and &quot;dogleg right&quot; if it bends right. Sometimes, a hole's direction may bend twice; this is called a &quot;double dogleg&quot;.

A regular golf course consists of 18 holes, but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570500/Golf.html#p2 |title=Golf |publisher=[[Encarta]] |accessdate=20 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwq81UW4?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570500/Golf.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hildenpark.co.uk/golf/golfcourse.html |title=Hill den Park &#8211; 9 Hole Golf Course |publisher=hilden park.co.uk |accessdate=20 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222001759/http://www.hildenpark.co.uk/golf/golfcourse.html |archivedate=22 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=links&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary definition of the word Links |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the term &quot;golf links&quot;, particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.

The first 18-hole golf course in the United States was on a sheep farm in [[Downers Grove, Illinois]], in 1892. The course is still there today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/golf-good-question-93041254.html |title=Why Does Golf Have 18 Holes? |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play of the game==
[[File:Golf field.svg|thumb|right|upright|1=teeing ground, 2=water hazard, 3=rough, 4=out of bounds, 5=[[Hazard (golf)#Bunker|sand bunker]], 6=water hazard, 7=fairway, 8=putting green, 9=flagstick, 10=hole]]
Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A &quot;round&quot; typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes.  The game can be played by any number of people. Though a typical group playing will have 1, 2, 3 or 4 people playing the round. The typical amount of time required for pace of play for a 9-hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18-hole round.

Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the [[teeing ground]] (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a [[Tee#Golf tee|tee]] prior to striking it. A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club (the &quot;sweet spot&quot;) for better distance.

When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance (typically more than {{convert|225|yd|-1}}), the shot is commonly called a &quot;drive&quot; and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed [[wood (golf)|wood]] club called a &quot;driver&quot;. Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods or [[Iron (golf)|irons]]. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a &quot;lay-up&quot;, an &quot;approach&quot;, a &quot;pitch&quot;, or a &quot;[[Golf stroke mechanics#Chip|chip]]&quot;, until the ball reaches the green, where he or she then &quot;[[putt]]s&quot; the ball into the hole (commonly called &quot;sinking the putt&quot; or &quot;holing out&quot;). The goal of getting the ball into the hole (&quot;holing&quot; the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called &quot;rough&quot; (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; &quot;doglegs&quot;, which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; [[Hazard (golf)#Bunker|bunkers]] (or sand traps); and [[Hazard (golf)#Water hazard|water hazards]] such as ponds or streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt;

In stroke play competitions played according to [[strict rules]], each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take. In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and &quot;surrender the hole&quot; after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the &quot;par&quot; rating of the hole (a &quot;triple bogey&quot; - see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3-2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids &quot;runaway scores&quot;, excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion.

The total distance from the first tee box to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages &quot;through the green&quot; can be in excess of {{convert|7000|yd}}, and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel five miles or more during a round. At some courses, electric [[golf carts]] are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a &quot;golf trolley&quot; for their bag. These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by [[caddy|caddies]], who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861593951/caddie.html |title=Caddie |publisher=[[Encarta]] |accessdate=24 December 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwq7UVSG?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861593951/caddie.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; A caddy's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddy is working, and not to other competing players.

The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&amp;A, spun off in 2004 from [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] (founded 1754), and the [[United States Golf Association]] (USGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/rules_of_golf.html# |title=The Rules of Golf |publisher=[[United States Golf Association]] |accessdate=7 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003259/http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/rules_of_golf.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ROG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randa.org/flash/rules/PDF/RoG2004.pdf |title=Rules of Golf |publisher=[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] |accessdate=7 November 2007 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031100139/http://www.randa.org/flash/rules/PDF/RoG2004.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:
:''Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair.''

There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usga.org/playing/amateur_status/amateur_status.html |title=Amateur Status |publisher=[[United States Golf Association]] |accessdate=7 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001153253/http://www.usga.org/playing/amateur_status/amateur_status.html |archivedate=1 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.

In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called [[golf etiquette]]. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.

===Penalties===
{{main article|Penalty (golf)}}
Penalties are incurred in certain situations. They are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one's ball into an unplayable situation.

A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 27&#8211;1). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 18&#8211;2). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's ball results into a red or yellow staked hazard (Rule 26). If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 19&#8211;2) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 19&#8211;5), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty. Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification. Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.&lt;ref name=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;[http://www.randa.org/flash/rules/PDF/WEB_ROG_spreads.pdf 2008&#8211;2011 Rules of Golf (free download)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029043057/http://www.randa.org/flash/rules/PDF/WEB_ROG_spreads.pdf |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
{{Main article|Golf equipment}}
[[File:Golf ball resting near fairway wood.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Wood (golf)|wood]] positioned ready to be swung and to strike a [[golf ball]]]]
[[Golf club]]s are used to hit the [[golf ball]]. Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or &quot;grip&quot;) on the top end and a club head on the bottom. Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degree loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance. The actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball.

Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types. [[Wood (golf)|Woods]] are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively &quot;open&quot; lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the ''driver'' or &quot;1-wood&quot;, which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to {{convert|300|yd}}, or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. [[Iron (golf club)|Irons]] are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the [[putter]], which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called [[hybrid (golf)|hybrids]], evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.

A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules. (Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called &quot;conforming&quot;.) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.

The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.

[[Golf ball]]s are spherical, usually white (although other colours are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays &quot;boundary layer&quot; separation and reduces the drag-inducing &quot;wake&quot; behind the ball,
thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClubHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home.aone.net.au/~byzantium/golf/ghistory.html|title=History of the Golf Club |accessdate=5 November 2007 |author=Nicholls, David|date=February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a soft &quot;boundary layer&quot; and a hard &quot;core&quot; enables both distance and spin.

A [[Tee#Golf tee|tee]] is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.

Many golfers wear [[Golf equipment#Shoes|golf shoes]] with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots.

A [[golf bag]] is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized [[golf cart]] during play. Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.

==Stroke mechanics==
[[File:Lady golfer.jpg|thumb|right|A golfer takes an approach shot on the fairway.]]
{{Main article|Golf stroke mechanics}}

The golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, the clubface is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.

Golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target (for a right-hander, the target is to their left). At address, the player's body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel, with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is typically positioned more to the &quot;front&quot; of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs, with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot. The ball is placed further &quot;back&quot; in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases. Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance, while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface, so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf.

The golfer chooses a golf club, grip, and stroke appropriate to the distance:
* The &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;full swing&quot; is used on the teeing ground and fairway, typically with a wood or long iron, to produce the maximum distance capable with the club. In the extreme, the windup can end with the shaft of the club parallel to the ground above the player's shoulders.
* The &quot;approach&quot; or &quot;3/4 swing&quot; is used in medium- and long-distance situations where an exact distance and good accuracy is preferable to maximum possible distance, such as to place the ball on the green or &quot;lay up&quot; in front of a hazard. The windup or &quot;backswing&quot; of such a shot typically ends up with the shaft of the club pointing straight upwards or slightly towards the player.
* The &quot;chip&quot; or &quot;half-swing&quot; is used for relatively short-distance shots near the green, with high-lofted irons and wedges. The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green, allowing it to roll out towards the hole. It can also be used from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie. The backswing typically ends with the head of the club between hip and head height.
* The &quot;putt&quot; is used in short-distance shots on or near the green, typically made with the eponymous &quot;putter&quot;, although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and then roll (a &quot;bump and run&quot;). The backswing and follow-through of the putt are both abbreviated compared to other strokes, with the head of the club rarely rising above the knee. The goal of the putt is usually to put the ball in the hole, although a long-distance putt may be called a &quot;lag&quot; and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously.

Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single &quot;plane&quot; of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.

Accuracy and consistency are typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that travels only {{convert|220|yd}} will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using &quot;more club&quot; (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go {{convert|280|yd}} but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may &quot;hook&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;, &quot;draw&quot;, &quot;fade&quot;, &quot;push&quot; or &quot;slice&quot; off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.

===Musculature===

A golf stroke uses muscles on [[Core (anatomy)|core]] (especially [[erector spinae muscles]] and [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] when turning), [[hamstring]], [[shoulder]], and [[wrist]]. Stronger muscles on wrist can prevent wrists from being twisted at swings, while stronger shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also deliver the impacts to elbows and even neck and lead to injury of them. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, to have movement at only one end of the muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jack Welch's 6 Ways Exercise | author= [[John Sitaras]]| publisher = [[Golf Digest]] (Korean edition) | date = November 14, 2013 | url = http://www.golfdigest.co.kr/gd/Magazine/textyle/749478 | accessdate = December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = George Soros' Exercise| author= [[John Sitaras]]| publisher = [[Golf Digest]] (Korean edition) | date = November 21, 2013 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWaDpV0VdPg | accessdate = December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of putting===
Putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf. As the game of golf has evolved, there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts. When the game originated, golfers would putt with their dominate hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip. This grip and putting style is known as &quot;conventional&quot;. There are many variations of conventional including overlap, where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky; interlock, where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger; double or triple overlap and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dave Pelz: Your best way to putt|url = http://www.golf.com/instruction/dave-pelz-your-best-way-putt|website = Golf.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, &quot;cross handed&quot; putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs. Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom. This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cross Handed Putting Grip, How It Can Improve Your Stroke|url = http://golf-info-guide.com/putters/how-a-cross-handed-grip-can-improve-your-putting/|website = golf-info-guide.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable putting styles include &quot;the claw&quot;, a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4. Controlling the Yips - PGA Digital Golf Academy|url = http://golfacademy.pga.com/video/002932_4-controlling-the-yips/|website = golfacademy.pga.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weak hand placed normally on the putter. Anchored putting, a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the players stomach or below the chin; the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. This style will be banned in 2016 on the profession circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usga.org/content/dam/usga/images/rules/anchoring/082715USGA-UNDERSTANDINGANCHOREDSTROKES-Finaluse.pdf|title = Anchored putting|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = United States Golf Association|last = USGA|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and handicapping==

===Par===
{{Main article|Par (score)}}[[File:The Phoenician-Canyon.jpg|thumb|A par-3 hole in Phoenician Golf Club, [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]]]]
[[File:Grand Cypress New Course 15th hole.jpg|thumb|A marker stone indicating that this hole is a par-5 hole]]
A hole is classified by its par, meaning the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt; The minimum par of any hole is 3 because par always includes a stroke for the tee shot and two putts.  Pars of 4 and 5 strokes are ubiquitous on golf courses; more rarely, a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. Strokes other than the tee shot and putts are expected to be made from the fairway; for example, a skilled golfer expects to reach the [[Putting green|green]] on a par-4 hole in two strokes&#8212;one from the tee (the &quot;drive&quot;) and another, second, stroke to the green (the &quot;approach&quot;)&#8212;and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par. Putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making &quot;green in regulation&quot; or GIR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_par.htm |title=Definition of Par |publisher=[[About.com]] |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer won't make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a GIR does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to &quot;hole out&quot;. Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.103.html|title=Stat &#8211; Greens in Regulation Percentage|newspaper=PGATour|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225&#8211;434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over {{convert|650|yd}}. These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between {{convert|240|and|280|yd}}; a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; the key question is &quot;how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway?&quot;. The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to &quot;lay up&quot; on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/od/handicaps/f/faq_parlengths.htm |title=Golf FAQ &#8211; What are the Yardage Guidelines for Par-3s, Par-4s and Par-5s? |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a par score never includes &quot;expected&quot; penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never &quot;expected&quot; to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.

Eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 72 for a complete round; this is based on an average par of 4 for every hole, and so is often arrived at by designing a course with an equal number of par-5 and par-3 holes, the rest being par-4. Many combinations exist that total to par-72, and other course pars exist from 68 up to 76, and are not less worthy than courses of par-72. Additionally, in some countries including the United States, courses are classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfer's playing [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] for a given course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/rulesofgolf/a/hfaq_sloperate.htm |title=Golf FAQ: What is Slope Rating? |author=Kelley, Brent |publisher=About.com |accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two primary difficulty ratings in the U.S. are the Course Rating, which is effectively the expected score for a zero-handicap &quot;scratch golfer&quot; playing the course (and may differ from the course par), and the Slope Rating, which is a measure of how much worse a &quot;bogey golfer&quot; (with an 18 handicap) would be expected to play than a &quot;scratch golfer&quot;. These two numbers are available for any USGA-sanctioned course, and are used in a weighted system to calculate handicaps (see below).

====Scoring====
The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's score is usually expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par score. A [[hole in one]] (or an &quot;ace&quot;) occurs when a golfer sinks their ball into the cup with their first stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt;

In a typical professional tournament or among &quot;scratch&quot; amateur players, &quot;birdie-bogey&quot; play is common; a player will &quot;lose&quot; a stroke by bogeying a hole, then &quot;gain&quot; one by scoring a birdie. Eagles are uncommon but not rare; however, only [[List of professional golfers who have hit an albatross#Major championships|18 players have scored an albatross]] in a men's major championship.

===Basic forms of golf===
There are two basic forms of golf play, match play and stroke play. Stroke play is more popular.

====Match play====
Two players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called [[match play]]. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is &quot;halved&quot; (or tied). The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other. In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead, and the remainder of the holes are not played. For example, if one party already has a lead of six holes, and only five holes remain to be played on the course, the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won &quot;6 &amp; 5&quot;. At any given point, if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining, the party leading the match is said to be &quot;dormie&quot;, and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes, thereby winning the match, or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes. When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played, it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt;

====Stroke play====
The score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in [[stroke play]]. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament.

===Other forms of play===
The other forms of play in the game of golf are bogey competition, skins, 9-points, stableford, team play, and unofficial team variations.

====Bogey competition====
A bogey competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in at informal tournaments. Its scoring is similar to match play, except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player. The player &quot;wins&quot; the hole if they score a birdie or better, they &quot;lose&quot; the hole if they score a bogey or worse, and they &quot;halve&quot; the hole by scoring par. By recording only this simple win-loss-halve score on the sheet, a player can shrug off a very poorly-played hole with a simple &quot;-&quot; mark and move on. As used in competitions, the player or pair with the best win-loss &quot;differential&quot; wins the competition.

====Skins====
A [[Skins Game|skins game]] is a variation on match play where each hole has an amount of money (the &quot;skin&quot;) attached. This may be prize money at the professional level (the most famous event to use these rules was the &quot;[[LG Skins Game]]&quot;, played at Indian Wells Golf Resort in California until 2008), or an amount wagered for each hole among amateur players. The player with the lowest score on the hole wins the skin for that hole; if two or more players tie for the lowest score, the skin carries over to the next hole. This continues until a player wins a hole outright, which may (and often does) result in a player receiving money for a previous hole that they hadn't tied for. If players tie the 18th hole, either all players or only the tying players repeat the 18th hole until an outright winner is decided for that hole (and all undecided skins).

====9-Points====
A nine-point game is another variant of match play typically played among threesomes, where each hole is worth a total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format can be used to wager on the game systematically; players each contribute the same amount of money to the pot, and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/od/golfterms/g/nine-points.htm |title=Nine Points Golf Game |publisher=Golf.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mulligansoftware.com/golf/events/nine_point.html |title=Golf Competition &amp;#124; 9-Point Game |publisher=Mulligansoftware.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stableford====
The [[Stableford]] system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole's par; the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score, adding 2, then subtracting the player's hole score, making the result zero if negative. Alternately stated, a double bogey or worse is zero points, a bogey is worth one point, par is two, a birdie three, an eagle four, and so on. The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural &quot;higher is better&quot; scoring, the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores (scoring an &quot;even&quot; in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36), discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole (a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole; their Stableford score for the hole would be zero, which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played), and the ability to simply pick up one's ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole, which speeds play.

The USGA and R&amp;A sanction a &quot;Modified Stableford&quot; system for scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of -1 and a double-bogey or worse -3. As with the original system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores on one or two holes won't wreck an entire game, but this system rewards &quot;bogey-birdie&quot; play more than the original, encouraging golfers to try to make the riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshot instead of simply parring each hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta&quot;/&gt;

====Team play====

* [[Foursome (golf)|Foursome]]: defined in Rule 29, this is played between two teams of two players each, in which each team has only one ball and players alternate playing it. For example, if players &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; form a team, &quot;A&quot; tees off on the first hole, &quot;B&quot; will play the second shot, &quot;A&quot; the third, and so on until the hole is finished. On the second hole, &quot;B&quot; will tee off (regardless who played the last putt on the first hole), then &quot;A&quot; plays the second shot, and so on. Foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_foursomes.htm |title=Definition of Foursomes |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Four-ball golf|Fourball]]: defined in Rules 30 and 31, this is also played between two teams of two players each, but every player plays their own ball and for each team, the lower score on each hole counts. Fourballs can be played as match play or stroke play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_fourball.htm |title=Definition of Fourball |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Unofficial team variations=====
* Scramble: also known as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.
* Champagne scramble: a combination of a scramble and best-ball, only the first shot of each hole is a scramble; all players tee off, decide on the best tee shot, then each player plays their own ball starting at that point until they hole out, without deciding any further &quot;best shots&quot;. The best score amongst the team's players is counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_scramble.htm |title=Definition of Scramble |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Better ball or best-ball: like fourball, each player plays the hole as normal, but the lowest score of all the players on the team counts as the team's score for the hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_betterbal.htm |title=Better Ball |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greensome (also known as Scotch Foursomes): also called modified alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick the best shot as in a scramble. The player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://golf.about.com/cs/golfterms/g/bldef_greensome.htm |title=Definition of Greensome |publisher=About.com |author=Kelley, Brent |accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.
* Wolf (also known as Ship, Captain &amp; Crew, Captain, Pig): a version of match play; with a foursome an order of play for each player is established for the duration of the round.  The first player hits a ball from the tee, then waits for each successive player to hit (2nd, 3rd and 4th).  After each player hits the 1st player has the option of choosing a partner for the hole (the 1st player is the Wolf for that hole) usually by calling Wolf before the next player hits.  Once a partner is picked, each two-some (the Wolf and his or her partner vs the remaining two players) scores their total strokes and the winning two-some is awarded 1-point each for winning a hole and zero points for tying.  The next hole, the rotation moves forward (e.g. the 2nd player is now hitting 1st and the Wolf and the previous Wolf hits last). A Wolf can decide to go alone to win extra points, but they must beat all other players in stroke play on that hole.  If alone, the Wolf is awarded 2-points for going alone after everyone has hit or 4 points for declaring Lone Wolf before anyone else hits.  If the Lone Wolf loses, to even one player, the 3 other players get 1-point each. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the round.  Strategically, care must be taken not to let a low-handicap player run away with all the points by being constantly paired with the Wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ida-intl.com/wwgc/rulesforgameofwolf.htm |title=Rules to the game of Wolf |publisher= |accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodriguez |first=Chi Chi |authorlink= |title=Chi Chi's Golf Games You Gotta Play |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Chi_Chi_s_Golf_Games_You_Gotta_Play.html?id=udB-TZiQ64MC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=2013-07-29 |year=2002 |publisher=Human Kenetics |location= |isbn=9780736046312 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shotgun start]]s are mainly used for amateur tournament play. In this variant, each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation to stroke or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.

===Handicap systems===
{{Main article|Handicap (golf)}}
A handicap is a numerical measure of an amateur golfer's ability to play golf over the course of 18 holes. A player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course of an above-average round of golf. The better the player the lower their handicap is. Someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a ''scratch golfer'', and would typically score or beat the course par on a round of play (depending on course difficulty).

Calculating a handicap is often complicated, the general reason being that golf courses are not uniformly challenging from course to course or between skill levels. A player scoring even par on Course A might average four over par on course B, while a player averaging 20 over par on course A might average only 16 over on course B. So, to the &quot;scratch golfer&quot;, Course B is more difficult, but to the &quot;bogey golfer&quot;, Course A is more difficult. The reasons for this are inherent in the types of challenges presented by the same course to both golfers. Distance is often a problem for amateur &quot;bogey&quot; golfers with slower swing speeds, who get less distance with each club, and so typically require more shots to get to the green, raising their score compared to a scratch golfer with a stronger swing. However, courses are often designed with hazard placement to mitigate this advantage, forcing the scratch player to &quot;lay up&quot; to avoid bunkers or water, while the bogey golfer is more or less unaffected as the hazard lies out of their range. Finally, terrain features and fairway maintenance can affect golfers of all skill levels; narrowing the fairway by adding obstacles or widening the rough on each side will typically increase the percentage of shots made from disadvantageous lies, increasing the challenge for all players.

By USGA rules, handicap calculation first requires calculating a &quot;Handicap Differential&quot; for each round of play the player has completed by strict rules. That in itself is a function of the player's &quot;gross adjusted score&quot; (adjustments can be made to mitigate various deviations either from strict rules or from a player's normal capabilities, for handicap purposes only) and two course-specific difficulty ratings: the Course Rating, a calculated expected score for a hypothetical &quot;scratch golfer&quot;: and the Slope Rating, a number based on how much worse a hypothetical 20-handicap &quot;bogey golfer&quot; would score compared to the &quot;scratch golfer&quot;. The average Slope Rating of all USGA-rated courses as of 2012 is 113, which also factors into the Differential computation.

The most recent Differentials are logged, up to 20 of them, and then the best of these (the number used depends on the number available) are selected, averaged, multiplied by .96 (an &quot;excellence factor&quot; that reduces the handicap of higher-scoring players, encouraging them to play better and thus lower their handicap), and truncated to the tenths place to produce the &quot;Handicap Index&quot;. Additional calculations can be used to place higher significance on a player's recent tournament scores. A player's Handicap Index is then multiplied by the Slope Rating of the course to be played, divided by the average Slope Rating of 113, then rounded to the nearest integer to produce the player's Course Handicap.

Once calculated, the Course Handicap is applied in stroke play by simply reducing the player's gross score by the handicap, to produce a net score. So, a gross score of 96 with a handicap of 22 would produce a net score of 74. In match play, the lower handicap is subtracted from the higher handicap, and the resulting handicap strokes are awarded to the higher handicapper by distributing them among the holes according to each hole's difficulty; holes are ranked on the scorecard from 1 to 18 (or however many holes are available), and one stroke is applied to each hole from the most difficult to the least difficult. So, if one player has a 9 handicap and another has a 25 handicap, the 25-handicap player receives one handicap stroke on each of the most difficult 16 holes (25-9). If the 25-handicapper were playing against a &quot;scratch golfer&quot; (zero handicap), all 25 strokes would be distributed, first by applying one stroke to each hole, then applying the remaining strokes, one each, to the most difficult 7 holes; so, the handicap player would subtract 2 strokes from each of the most difficult 7 holes, and 1 each from the remaining 11.

Handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap (&quot;throwing their 'cap&quot;) before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize. For this reason, professional golf associations do not use them, but they can be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players. Touring professionals, being the best of the best, often have negative handicaps; they can be expected, on average, to score lower than the Course Rating on any course.

In 2005 ''[[Golf Digest]]'' calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita, in order, were: Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, Canada, Wales, United States, Sweden, and England (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded).

The number of course in other territories increases, an example of this being the expansion of [[golf in China]]. The first golf course in China opened in 1984, but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country. For much of the 21st century, development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of [[Hainan]]), but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009; the &quot;ban&quot; has been evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;China golf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/columns/story?id=4618648 |title=Olympics makes China major player |first=Dan |last=Washburn |publisher=ESPN  |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional golf==
{{Main article|Professional golfer}}
The majority of [[professional golfer]]s work as club or teaching professionals (&quot;pros&quot;), and only compete in local competitions. A small elite of professional golfers are &quot;tournament pros&quot; who compete full-time on international &quot;tours&quot;. Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as [[caddy|caddies]] or with a general interest in the game, finding employment at [[golf course]]s and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession. These programs include independent institutions and universities, and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification. Touring professionals typically start as amateur players, who attain their &quot;pro&quot; status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and/or notice from corporate sponsors. [[Jack Nicklaus]], for example, gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] to champion [[Arnold Palmer]], with a 72-hole score of 282 (the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur). He played one more amateur year in 1961, winning that year's [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur Championship]], before turning pro in 1962.

===Instruction===
[[File:Indoor Putting Green.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Indoor [[Golf course#Putting green|putting green]] for practice and instruction]]
{{Main article|Golf instruction}}

Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the [[Professional Golfers Association]]. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course.

===Golf tours===
{{Main article|Professional golf tours}}
There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a [[Professional Golfers Association|PGA]] or an independent tour organization, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Typically a tour has &quot;members&quot; who are entitled to compete in most of its events, and also invites non-members to compete in some of them. Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive, and most professional golfers never achieve it.

[[File:All Black.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gary Player]] is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of golf.]]
Perhaps the most widely known tour is the [[PGA Tour]], which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 [[USD]]. The [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]], which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige. Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour. Since 2010, both tours' money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times, with [[Luke Donald]] doing so in 2011 and [[Rory McIlroy]] in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, [[Henrik Stenson]] won the [[FedEx Cup]] points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title, but did not top the PGA Tour money list (that honour going to [[Tiger Woods]]).

The other leading men's tours include the [[Japan Golf Tour]], the [[Asian Tour]] (Asia outside Japan), the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]], and the [[Sunshine Tour]] (for southern Africa, primarily South Africa). The Japan, Australasian, Sunshine, PGA, and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world's main tours, the International Federation of PGA Tours, founded in 1996. The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999. The [[PGA Tour Canada|Canadian Tour]] became an associate member of the Federation in 2000, and the [[Tour de las Am&#233;ricas]] (Latin America) became an associate member of the Federation in 2007. The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members&amp;nbsp;&#8211; the Canadian Tour, Tour de las Am&#233;ricas, China Golf Association, the Korea Professional Golfers' Association, [[Professional Golf Tour of India]], and the operators of all six major women's tours worldwide. The [[OneAsia Tour]], founded in 2009, is not a member of the Federation, but was founded as a joint venture of the Australasia, China, Japan, and Korean tours. In 2011, the Tour de las Am&#233;ricas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour, and in 2012 was folded into the new [[PGA Tour Latinoam&#233;rica]]. Also in 2012, the Canadian Tour was renamed [[PGA Tour Canada]] after it agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour. All men's tours that are Federation members, except the India tour, offer points in the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] (OWGR) to players who place sufficiently high in their events. The OneAsia Tour also offers ranking points.

Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players. There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over, arguably the best known of which is the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour Champions]].

There are six principal tours for women, each based in a different country or continent. The most prestigious of these is the United States-based [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]]. All of the principal tours offer points in the [[Women's World Golf Rankings]] for high finishers in their events.

All of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour, in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season. Examples include the [[Web.com Tour]], which feeds to the PGA Tour, and the [[Challenge Tour]], which is the developmental tour of the European Tour. The Web.com and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points.

===Men's major championships===

{{Main article|Men's major golf championships}}

The major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year. In chronological order they are: [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]], the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]] (referred to in North America as the British Open) and the [[PGA Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supersport.com/golf/golf-globe/future-venues-dates-golf-majors|title=Future Men`s Major Championships - dates and venues - SuperSport - Golf|website=www.supersport.com|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. The Masters has been played at [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in Augusta, Georgia, since its inception in 1934. It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-world.co.uk/masters-golf-tournament.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917081123/http://www.sporting-world.co.uk:80/masters-golf-tournament.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 September 2006 |title=Golf Majors: The Masters Golf Tournament |publisher=Sporting-World.co.uk |accessdate=17 December 2007}} &lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States, while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theopen.com/Heritage/OpenVenues|title=The Open - Open Venues|website=www.theopen.com|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters, the four Majors were the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur, the Open Championship, and the [[The Amateur Championship|British Amateur]].

===Women's major championships===

{{Main article|Women's major golf championships}}
Women's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of majors recognised by the dominant women's tour, the [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]] in the U.S., has changed several times over the years, with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013. Like the PGA Tour, the (U.S.) LPGA&lt;ref&gt;There are several bodies known as the &quot;LPGA&quot;, each based in a different country or continent. The U.S. LPGA is the only one without a geographic identifier in its name, as it was the first to be founded. Typically, if the term &quot;LPGA&quot; is used without an identifier, it refers to the U.S. body.&lt;/ref&gt; tour long had four majors, but now has five: the [[ANA Inspiration]] (previously known by several other names, most recently the Kraft Nabisco Championship), the [[Women's PGA Championship]] (previously known as the LPGA Championship),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.pga.com/pga-america/pga-feature/pga-america-lpga-kpmg-join-forces-kpmg-womens-pga-championship |publisher=PGA of America |title=PGA of America, LPGA, KPMG join forces for KPMG Women's PGA Championship |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Women's Open Championship (golf)|U.S. Women's Open]], the [[Women's British Open]] (which replaced the [[Canadian Women's Open|du Maurier Classic]] as a major in 2001) and [[The Evian Championship]] (added as the fifth major in 2013). Only the last two are also recognised as majors by the [[Ladies European Tour]]. However, the significance of this is limited, as the LPGA is far more dominant in women's golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men's golf. For example, the [[BBC]] has been known to use the U.S. definition of &quot;women's majors&quot; without qualifying it. Also, the [[Ladies' Golf Union]], the governing body for women's golf in Great Britain and Ireland, stated on its official website that the Women's British Open was &quot;the only Women's Major to be played outside the U.S.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgu.org/championships/women__s_british_open/ |title=Women's British Open breaks new ground at St Andrews |publisher=Ladies' Golf Union |accessdate=12 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815190852/http://www.lgu.org/championships/women__s_british_open/ |archivedate=15 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; (this was before the elevation of The Evian Championship to major status). For many years, the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U.S., but that changed beginning in 2008, when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship. The second-richest women's tour, the [[LPGA of Japan Tour]], does not recognise any of the U.S. LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors (historically three, since 2008 four). However, these events attract little notice outside Japan.

===Senior major championships ===
{{Main article|Senior major golf championships}}
Senior (aged fifty and over) men's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of senior majors on the U.S.-based [[PGA Tour Champions]] has changed over the years, but always by expansion. PGA Tour Champions now recognises five majors: the [[Senior PGA Championship]], [[The Tradition]], the [[Senior Players Championship]], the [[United States Senior Open]], and [[Senior Open Championship|The Senior (British) Open Championship]].

Of the five events, the Senior PGA is by far the oldest, having been founded in 1937. The other events all date from the 1980s, when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as [[Arnold Palmer]] and [[Gary Player]], reached the relevant age. The Senior British Open was not recognised as a major by PGA Tour Champions until 2003. The [[European Seniors Tour]] recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors. However, PGA Tour Champions is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U.S. LPGA is in global women's golf.

        '''Miniature golf''', also known as '''minigolf''', or '''putt-putt''', is an offshoot of the [[sport]] of [[golf]] focusing solely on the putting aspect of its parent game. It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of 9) similar to its parent, but characterized by their short length (usually within 10 yards from tee to cup), the use of artificial putting surfaces such as carpet, astroturf and/or concrete, a geometric layout often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels/tubes, ramps, concrete/metal/fiberglass forms, and moving obstacles such as windmills.  When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.

==Nomenclature==
While the international sports organization World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.com : MINIGOLFSPORT.COM :. - World minigolf sport federation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; prefers to use the name &quot;minigolf&quot;, the general public in different countries has also many other names for the game: miniature golf, mini-golf, midget golf, goofy golf, shorties, extreme golf, crazy golf, adventure golf, mini-putt, putter golf and so on. The name [[Putt-Putt Fun Center|Putt-Putt]] is the [[trademark]] of an American company&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puttputt.com/ Welcome to Putt Putt Fun Centers!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that builds and franchises miniature golf courses in addition to other family-oriented entertainment, and the term &quot;putt-putt&quot; is sometimes used colloquially to refer to the game itself. The term &quot;Minigolf&quot; was formerly a registered trademark of a Swedish company that built its own patented type of minigolf courses. Resort towns such as [[Myrtle Beach, SC]], [[Branson, MO]], [[Pigeon Forge, TN]] and [[Wisconsin Dells, WI]] are known for their numerous minigolf courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svbgf.se/index.htm BANGOLF - Bangolf - bangolf - UPPKOMST OCH UTVECKLING&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Geometrically-shaped minigolf courses made of artificial materials (carpet) began to emerge during the early 20th century. The earliest documented mention of such a course is in the 8 June 1912 edition of ''The Illustrated London News'', which introduces a minigolf course called Gofstacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/gofstacle.html ''The Illustrated London News'' June 8 1912&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standardized minigolf courses to enter commercial mass-production were the [[Thistle Dhu]] (&quot;This'll Do&quot;) course 1916 in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina|Pinehurst]], [[North Carolina]], and the 1927 Tom Thumb patent of [[Garnet Carter]] from [[Lookout Mountain]], Tennessee. [[Thomas McCulloch Fairbairn (inventor)]], a golf fanatic, revolutionized the game in 1922 with his formulation of a suitable artificial green&amp;mdash;a mixture of cottonseed hulls, sand, oil, and dye. With this discovery, miniature golf became accessible everywhere; by the late 1920s there were over 150 rooftop courses in [[New York City]] alone, and tens of thousands across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5r8JTaa6Ismr8AaNmb2iAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Why Midget Golf Swept The Country&quot;, November 1930, Popular Science]&lt;/ref&gt;  This American minigolf boom of early 20th century came to an end during the economic depression in the late 1930s. Nearly all minigolf courses in the United States were closed and demolished before the end of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;haeber&quot;&gt;[http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~haeber/creations/minigolf.html History of Miniature Golf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare surviving example from this period is the [[Parkside Whispering Pines Miniature Golf Course]] located near [[Rochester, New York]], and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first miniature golf course in [[Canada]] was at the Maples Inn in [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]]. The &quot;Mapes&quot; was constructed as a summer home in the 1890s but was renovated into a club in 1902, opened to the public in 1914, and had a miniature golf course in 1930. The popular nightspot burned in 1985. (See: [[West Island Chronicle]], June 29, 2008.)

===European origins===
[[File:Minigolf Ascona.jpg||thumb|right|Minigolf Ascona, opened in 1954]]
One of the first documented minigolf courses in mainland Europe was built in 1926 by Fr. Schr&#246;der in Hamburg, Germany. Mr. Schr&#246;der had been inspired by his visit to the United States, where he had seen minigolf courses spreading across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;bganormy&quot;&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.se/bganormy.htm#ty BANGOLF - Bangolf - bangolf - UPPKOMST OCH UTVECKLING&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Edwin O. Norrman and Eskil Norman returned to Sweden from the United States, where they had stayed for several years and witnessed the golden days of the American minigolf boom. In 1931 they founded a company &quot;Norman och Norrmans Miniatyrgolf&quot;, and began manufacturing standardized minigolf courses for the Swedish market. During the following years they spread this new leisure activity across Sweden, by installing minigolf courses in public parks and other suitable locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bganormy&quot;/&gt;

Swedish minigolf courses typically had a rectangular wooden frame surrounding the playing area made of tennis field sand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citygolf.se/english/history.html The history of minigolf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (while the American manufacturers used newly developed and patented felt as the surface of their minigolf courses). Felt did not become popular as a surface material in Sweden until in the mid-1960s&#8212;but since then it has become practically the only surface material used in Scandinavia and Britain, due to its favorable playing qualities in wet weather. (Minigolf courses with a felt surface can be played in rainy weather, because water soaks through the felt into the ground. The other commonly used surface materials, beton and eternite, cannot be used in rainy weather, because the rainwater pools on them, stopping the ball from rolling.)

The Swedish Minigolf Federation (Svenska Bangolff&#246;rbundet)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangolf.se/ Svenska Bangolff&#246;rbundet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1937, being the oldest minigolf sport organization in the world. National Swedish championships in minigolf have been played yearly since 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.se/historik/bgresumy.htm ]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries minigolf sport federations were not founded until the late 1950s, due to the post-war economical depression.

In 1954, the minigolf course in [[Ascona]] (Switzerland) opened, the oldest course worldwide following the norms of Paul Bongni.

===Competitive games===
The earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States. The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930, with a total cash purse $10,000 (the top prize being $2,000). Qualification play-offs were played in all of the 48 states, and the final competition on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee attracted over 200 players representing thirty states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prominigolf.com/history.html Welcome to US ProMiniGolf Association - The Official Internet Site For Prominigolf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Depression ten years later, minigolf died out as a competition sport in America, and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades. The American minigolf sport boom of the 1930s inspired many European countries, and the sport of minigolf lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression.

===Post-depression USA===
[[File:Monster_Mini_Golf_Glow_in_the_Dark_Golfer.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Golfer golfing at [[Monster Mini Golf]], an indoor glow in the dark mini golf course.]]
In 1938 Joseph and Robert Taylor from [[Binghamton]], [[New York (state)|New York]] started building and operating their own miniature golf courses. These courses differed from the ones in the late 20s and early 30s; they were no longer just rolls, banks, and curves, with an occasional pipe thrown in. Their courses not only had [[landscaping]], but also [[obstacle]]s, including [[windmills]], [[castles]], and [[wishing well]]s.

Impressed by the quality of the courses, many customers asked if the Taylors would build a course for them. By the early 1940s, Joe and Bob formed Taylor Brothers, and were in the business of building miniature golf courses and supplying obstacles to the [[industry]]. During both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, many a G.I. played on a Taylor Brothers [[prefabricated]] course that the U.S. [[Military]] had contracted to be built and shipped overseas.

By the late 50s almost all supply catalogs carried Taylor Brothers' obstacles. In 1961 Bob Taylor, Don Clayton of [[Putt-Putt Fun Center|Putt-Putt]], and Frank Abramoff of [[Arnold Palmer]] Miniature Golf organized the first miniature golf association known as NAPCOMS (or the &quot;National Association of Putting Course Operators, Manufacturers, and Suppliers&quot;). Their first meeting was held in [[New York City]]. Though this [[organization]] only lasted a few years it was the first attempt to bring miniature golf operators together to promote miniature golf.

In 1955, [[Lomma Golf]], Inc., founded by Al Lomma and his brother [[Ralph Lomma]], led the revival of wacky, animated trick hazards. These hazards required both accurately aimed shots and split-second timing to avoid spinning windmill blades, [[revolving]] [[statuary]], and other careening obstacles.

The book ''Tilting At Windmills (How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Sport)'' by Andy Miller tells the story of the formerly sports-hating author attempting to change by competing in miniature golf, including events in [[Denmark]] and [[Latvia]].

In the [[United States]], National Miniature Golf Day is held yearly on the second Saturday of May. The event had its [[inaugural]] [[party|celebration]] on May 12, 2007, and was officially recognized and published in 2008's edition of ''[[Chase's Calendar of Events]]''.

==Other countries==
Minigolf has so far not reached wide popularity outside Europe and North America.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The reason is probably economic, at least to some extent: the less wealthy countries invest their limited sports funds into such sports that enjoy widest public attention and media coverage, leaving the less popular sports with little or no funding at all. (Minigolf is one of the most popular outdoor games in Europe and America, though, but only as an occasional leisure activity, not as a competitive sport.)

By the 1950s the American Putt-Putt company was exporting their minigolf courses to South Africa, Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, and the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.se/bganormy.htm#us BANGOLF - Bangolf - bangolf - UPPKOMST OCH UTVECKLING&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Minigolf courses are found in all parts of the world, but their popularity is by far highest in the USA, the UK, New Zealand, Scandinavia, and central Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Governing body==

The sport of miniature golf is governed internationally by the [[World Minigolf Sport Federation]] (WMF), headquartered in G&#246;teborg, Sweden.  The WMF is a member of [[SportAccord]].  It organises World Championships for youth and elite players, and Continental Championships in Europe, Asia and the USA, held in alternate years.

==Course types==

All competitions approved by World Minigolfsport Federation are played on standardized courses, whose design has been checked to be suitable for competitive play. The WMF currently approves four different course types:
* [[Concrete|Beton]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_italy_vergiate.html |title=Minigolfpics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114193735/http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_italy_vergiate.html |archivedate=January 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated B, sometimes called &quot;Bongni&quot; and named after Paul Bongni of Geneva, Switzerland, &quot;Minigolf&quot; or &quot;Abteilung 1&quot;)
* [[Eternit|Eternite]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_luxembourg_luxembourg.html |title=Minigolfpics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116035221/http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_luxembourg_luxembourg.html |archivedate=January 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated E (in Sweden EB), sometimes called &quot;Europabana&quot;, &quot;Miniaturgolf&quot; or &quot;Abteilung 2&quot;)
* [[Felt]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_sweden_ornskoldsvik.html |title=Minigolfpics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221215350/http://www.minigolfpics.com/html/courses_sweden_ornskoldsvik.html |archivedate=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated F or SFR, sometimes called &quot;Swedish felt runs&quot;), and
* Minigolf Open System&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/belfast.html Belfast, Adventure Golf - The Captain's Challenge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated &quot;O&quot;, &quot;OS&quot; or &quot;MOS&quot;). The latter non-standardized playing system, MOS, covers all minigolf courses that the three standardized systems (B, E, F) do not cover.

The world record on one round of minigolf is 18 strokes on 18 holes. More than a thousand players have officially achieved this score on eternite. On other playing systems a perfect round of 18 holes-in-one is extremely rare, and has never been scored in an official national or international tournament. Unofficial 18-rounds on concrete and felt courses have been reported in Sweden.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In addition to classical outdoor miniature golf, indoor &quot;glow in the dark&quot; miniature golf has achieved some popularity, especially in colder climates like Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puttingedge.com/locations.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111100150/http://www.puttingedge.com/locations.htm |date=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hohtogolf.fi/ |title=Hohtogolf West Coast |publisher=Hohtogolf.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be played throughout the year, and climate control allows building elaborate obstacles that would not withstand inclement weather.
There are also a variety of portable miniature golf fairways or 'tracks'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author='+relative_time(twitters[i].created_at)+' |url=http://www.urbancrazy.com/ |title=UrbanCrazy |publisher=UrbanCrazy |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be set up as temporary courses indoors or outdoors. The fairways are usually constructed of wooden or glass fibre frames. Portable fairways are often used for summer festivals and fairs, corporate events, team-building events, and product launches.

The 18th and final holes of many miniature golf courses are designed to literally capture the ball, effectively preventing the player from playing additional rounds without purchasing another game.  This may be accomplished with a &quot;drain&quot; or trap-door hole setup that channels the ball to a lockbox.  One popular method of theming the 18th hole in the United States is to use a gated, ramped target area depicting the face of a [[clown]]; if the ball lands &quot;in&quot; the clown's nose, a bell might sound and the player would win a discount ticket for another game.

==Competitions and tournaments==
Nearly all European countries have an official national federation for promoting minigolf as a competition sport. The bi-annual European Championships attract competitors from more than twenty European countries. As of 2012, Thomas Downes has been the holder of the European Championship title.&lt;ref name=&quot;results&quot;&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.com/results.php World minigolf sport federation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Europe only a small number of countries have participated in international minigolf competitions. These countries include USA, Japan, China, India and Taiwan. A national minigolf federation exists also in Moldova, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, but none of these countries has ever participated in international competitions, and probably are not arranging many domestic competitions either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.com/members.html World minigolf sport federation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

World Minigolfsport Federation represents some 40,000 registered competition players from 37 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.miniaturegolfer.com/minigolf_olympics.html Minigolf: From Summer Holidays to the Summer Olympics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The national minigolf federation of Germany has 11,000 members with a competing license,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolfsport.de/download/bundesliga2007.pdf 1.4. Mainz-Hartenbergpark 29.4. Kiel-Gaarden 13.5. Bamberg 3.6. N&amp;#252;mbrecht 1.7. Brechten 28.7. Bad Sobernheim&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish federation has 8,000 registered competition players.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.bangolf.se/t2.aspx?p=112569 Svenska Bangolff&#246;rbundet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other strong minigolf countries include Austria and Switzerland, each having a few thousand licensed competition players. Also Italy, Czech Republic and Netherlands have traditionally been able to send a strong team to international championships, even if they cannot count their licensed players in thousands.

The sceptre of competitive minigolf rests quite firmly in mainland Europe: no player from other countries (such as UK, USA, Japan et cetera) has ever reached even the top 50 in World Championships (in men's category).&lt;ref name=&quot;results&quot;/&gt; Nearly all national federations outside Europe were founded only quite recently (within the last 10 years), and it will take time before the players of these countries learn all secrets of the game. USA has a longer history of minigolf competitions, but the standardized European competition courses are practically unknown in USA, and therefore the American players have been unable to learn the secrets of European minigolf. On the traditional American courses the best American players are able to challenge the European top players into a tough and exciting competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigolftraining.com/Results%20documents/2006%20USPMGA%20Master.doc ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620150016/http://www.minigolftraining.com/Results%20documents/2006%20USPMGA%20Master.doc |date=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Minigolf Association (BMGA) has an additional &amp;ndash; and quite surprising &amp;ndash; problem on their way to greater success in competitive minigolf. While the minigolf federations in mainland Europe receive annual funding from the government, in England the national sports organisation [[Sport England]] has refused to accept BMGA as its member &amp;ndash; which means that BMGA is left without the public funding that other forms of sports enjoy. The rules of Sport England declare that only one variant of each sport can be accepted as member &amp;ndash; and minigolf is interpreted as a variant of golf.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

No person is known to be earning his living by competing in minigolf. Many course owners and employees naturally earn their living by working at minigolf courses, and some of the best minigolf players earn their living from minigolf-related work, such as giving putting lessons to golf players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puttabra.nu/ Puttr&#228;ning med v&#228;rldens b&#228;sta bangolfare - Puttabra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest money prizes are paid in the United States, where the winner of a major competition may earn up to 5,000 US dollars. In mainland Europe the money prizes are generally quite low, and in many cases honor is the only thing at stake in the competition. International championships usually award no money prizes at all.

In the US there are two organizations offering national [[tournament]]s: the [[Professional Putters Association]] and the [[US Pro Mini-Golf Association]] (USPMGA). The USPMGA represents the United States in the World Minigolfsport Federation, having been an active member since 1995. USPMGA President Robert Detwiler is also the WMF representative for [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].

New Israeli Minigolf Association was established in February 2010 in Israel. Setting up, for the first time, league playing according to the rules of WMF and USPMGA. Now, a series of lush and inviting minigolf parks in prime locations are building around Israel and will be offering this need of adventure to the public at very attractive surrounding.

===International tournaments===

World Minigolfsport Federation (WMF), a member of [http://www.agfisonline.com/ AGFIS], organises World Championships biennially (on odd-numbered years), while the continental championships in Europe and Asia are organized on even-numbered years. Many of these competitions are arranged for three age groups: juniors (under 20 years), adults (no age limit), and seniors (over 45 years).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minigolfsport.com/rules/3_1_060730.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women compete separately in their own categories, except in some team competitions and pair competitions. The difference in the playing skills of men and women is very small on top level, however: it is not unheard-of that the best player in a major international tournament is female. Typically the winner in women's category would be very close to medals also in men's category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oebgv.at/index.php?page=ergebnisse_international &#214;sterreichischer Bahnengolfverband - Internationale Minigolfergebnisse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

World and European Championships have so far never been arranged on MOS courses (which are popular in USA and UK, and were approved by WMF for competition use only a few years ago). International competitions are typically arranged on two courses of 18 holes, of which one course is eternite, and the other course is usually concrete, less commonly felt. In the future, the WMF is expected to use also MOS courses in international championships &amp;ndash; which will give American and British players a chance to show their skills on their own traditional course types.

The most prestigious MOS minigolf competitions in the world are the US Masters, US Open, British Open, Kent Open, World Crazy Golf Championships and the World Adventuregolf Masters.

A '''tennis court''' is the venue where the sport of [[tennis]] is played. It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the center. The same surface can be used to play both [[Types of tennis match|doubles and singles]] matches. A variety of surfaces can be used to create a tennis court, each with its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game.

==Dimensions==
[[File:Tennis court imperial.svg|thumb|The dimensions of a tennis court.]]
Tennis is played on a rectangular flat surface, usually of [[Grass court|grass]], [[Clay court|clay]] or [[hardcourt|hard]] material. The dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) governing body and are written down in the annual 'Rules of Tennis' document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Rules of Tennis|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/0|publisher=ITF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court is {{convert|78|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} long. Its width is {{convert|27|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for singles matches and {{convert|36|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} for doubles matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rule 1 - The Court&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itf.uberflip.com/i/428396-2015-rules-of-tennis-english/5|title=Rule 1 &#8211; The Court|publisher=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service line is {{convert|21|ft|m|2|abbr=off}} from the net.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rule 1 - The Court&quot;/&gt; Additional clear space around the court is needed in order for players to reach overrun balls for a total of {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=off}} long. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=off}} high at the posts, and {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} high in the center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0125827/tennis.htm Rules of tennis]&lt;/ref&gt; The net posts are {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=off}} outside the singles court on each side.

==Surfaces==
Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: [[clay]] courts, hard courts, [[lawn|grass]] courts and carpet courts. The [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Pace Classification Programme|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/class.asp|publisher=ITF|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Category 1 (slow)
* Category 2 (medium-slow)
* Category 3 (medium)
* Category 4 (medium-fast)
* Category 5 (fast)

Of the current [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments, the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] and [[Australian Open]] use hard courts, the [[French Open]] is played on clay, and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] is played on grass and is the only Grand Slam tournament to have always been played on one surface. The Australian Open switched to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only one of the four majors to have been played on three surfaces; the tournament was played on grass from its inception until 1974, on green clay until 1977, and on hard courts since the tournament moved from the [[West Side Tennis Club]] to the [[Billie Jean King National Tennis Center|National Tennis Center]] in 1978.

ITF uses the following classification for tennis court surface types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITF Approved Tennis Balls, Classified Surfaces &amp; Recognised Courts 2015|url=http://www.itftennis.com/media/200593/200593.pdf|publisher=ITF|page=62|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clay courts===
{{Main|Clay court}}
[[File:ND DN 2006FO.jpg|thumbnail|The [[French Open]] is played on clay courts.]]
Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone, or brick.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;/&gt; The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to use clay courts.

Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce in comparison to grass courts or hard courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;/&gt; For this reason, the clay court takes away many of the advantages of big serves, which makes it hard for serve-based players to dominate on the surface. Clay courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay's water content must be balanced; green courts generally require the courts to be sloped to allow water run-off.

Clay courts are more common in Europe and Latin America than in North America and tend to heavily favour baseline players.

===Grass courts===
{{Main|Grass court}}
[[File:London - Wimbledon - 3065.jpg|thumb|right|Grass court maintenance at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]]]
Grass courts are the fastest type of courts in common use.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;/&gt; They consist of grass grown on very hard-packed soil, which adds additional variables: bounces depend on how healthy the grass is, how recently it has been mown, and the wear and tear of recent play. [[point (tennis)|Point]]s are usually very quick where fast, low bounces keep rallies short, and the [[serve (tennis)|serve]] plays a more important role than on other surfaces. Grass courts tend to favour [[serve-and-volley]] tennis players.

Grass courts were once among the most common tennis surfaces, but are now rare due to high maintenance costs, as they must be watered and mown often, and take a longer time to dry after rain than hard courts. The grass surface, however, is the most compatible with the human body because of its softness.

===Hard courts===
{{Main|Hardcourt}}
[[File:RoofCourt.jpg|thumb|right|Rooftop tennis hardcourts in Downtown [[Singapore]]]]
Hard courts are made of uniform rigid material, often covered  with an acrylic surface layer,&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;/&gt; offering greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions|url=https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40E14F9345813738DDDAA0894D9415B828DF1D3|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard courts can vary in speed, although they are faster than clay but not as fast as grass courts. The quantity of sand added to the paint can greatly affect the rate at which the ball slows down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennisuniversal.com/Data/product_search_res.asp?SearchCateg=050206&amp;ProductCateg=0500&amp;SubCateg1=0502&amp;SubCateg2=050206This Tennis Universal]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] is played on [[DecoTurf]], while the [[Australian Open]] is played on [[Plexicushion]], both acrylic topped hard court surfaces.

===Carpet courts===
{{Main|Carpet court}}
[[File:Field club tennis courts in central old part of Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|Artificial turf tennis courts in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
&quot;Carpet&quot; in tennis means any removable court covering.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/facilities/facilities-guide/surface-descriptions.aspx|title=Surface Descriptions|website=itftennis.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indoor arenas store rolls of rubber-backed court surfacing and install it temporarily for tennis events, however they are not in use any more for professional events. A short [[pile (textile)|piled]] form of [[artificial turf]] infilled with sand is used for some outdoor courts, particularly in Asia. Carpet is generally a fast surface, faster than hardcourt, with low bounce.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITF Surfaces&quot;/&gt;

Notable tennis tournaments previously held on carpet courts were the [[WCT Finals]], [[Paris Masters]], [[U.S. Pro Indoor]] and [[Kremlin Cup]]. Since 2009 their use has been discontinued on the ATP and WTA tours.

==Indoor courts==
Any court surface may be used indoors. Hard courts&lt;ref name=&quot;Hard Courts Make Tennis Champions&quot;/&gt; are most common indoors, as they are made with the most versatile materials and surface finishes. Clay courts are installed indoors with underground watering systems, and used mostly for [[Davis Cup]] matches. The conclusion of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], in 2012, was played on the lawn of the [[Centre Court]] under the roof and artificial lights. Carpet surfaces have been used both on the [[ATP World Tour]] and the [[World Championship Tennis]] circuit, though no events currently use them. Historically, other surfaces have been used indoors, such as hardwood at the defunct [[World Covered Court Championships]] and the [[London Indoor Professional Championships]]. Currently, the [[ATP World Tour Finals]] event is the most important indoor tennis tournament.

==Smaller courts==
The [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] campaign ''Play and Stay'' aims to increase tennis participation worldwide, by improving the way children are introduced to the game. The campaign promotes playing on smaller courts with slower red, orange and green balls. This gives children more time and control so that they can serve, rally, and score from the first lesson on courts that are sized to fit their bodies. The ITF has mandated that official competition for children under 10 years of age should be played on so-called Orange courts {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|6.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Competition for children under 8 years is played on Red courts that are {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. The net is 0.8m high in the center.&lt;ref name=playstay&gt;[http://www.tennisplayandstay.com ITF Play and Stay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{main|Glossary of tennis terms}}

Common tennis court terms:

* ''Advantage service box'' or ''ad court'': The receiver's left side service box, or the opponent's right for the server; significant as the receiving side for an advantage point.
* ''Alley'' or ''Tramlines'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/rules_and_equipment/4222680.stm | title=BBC Sports: Basic rules of tennis | accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lanes on each side of the singles court. These are only used when playing doubles.
* ''Back court'': The area between the baseline and the service line.
* ''Baseline'': The rearmost line of the court, furthest from and parallel to the net.
* ''Center service line'': The line dividing the two service boxes on each side.
* ''Center mark'': The 12-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the two halves (and service boxes) of a tennis court.
* ''Deuce service box'' or ''deuce court'': The receiver's right side service box, or the opponent's left for the server, significant as the receiving side for a deuce point.
* ''Service box'': The area on each side bounded by the singles sideline, the service line, and the net. There are left and right service boxes, separated by the center service line.
* ''Service line'': The line that is parallel to the net and is located between the baseline and the net. It marks the end of the service boxes.
* ''Side T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the singles sideline. There are four such side Ts, two on each side of the net.
* ''T'' or ''Middle T'': The T shape formed by the service line and the center service line.
